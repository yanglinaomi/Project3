Regular users can also post deals they come across. Come check out some of the roasters and other coffee-related businesses that Redditors work for!

Note that this thread will be weekly at least for the duration of the COVID-19 outbreak, since many roasters are running more specials than usual to drum up business.

We encourage everyone to post deals here especially since many roasters are holding specials to drive business affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. However, note that there will be zero tolerance for shady behavior. If you're found to be acting dishonestly here, your posting will be removed and we will consider banning you on the spot. If you yourself are affiliated with a business, please be transparent about it.

Coffee,"So, I watched James Hoffman's video on adding salt (really, saline solution) to coffee to mitigate bitterness and I started thinking of coffee additives.

Here I am not talking about milk drinks. This is stuff you add to your low-effort home brew filter/french press stuff. Casual coffee drinking.

The classic ones, sugar and dairy, are fairly well-understood. Vegan milk replacements are, depending on brand and formulation, are also quite nice IMO, and artificial sweeteners is mostly interchangeable with sugar.

Here's my answer:

I'm currently experimenting with MSG (monosodium glutamate.)

Coffee,I recently made my first ever batch of cold brew with a ratio of 3 oz ground coffee to 24 oz of water. This yielded about 3 cups of coffee. This seems far more expensive than a regular hot cup of coffee would be to brew. Is there a way I can perfect my ratios? Should I let it steep for longer (I waited about 18 hours)? Perhaps my grind was not coarse enough. What are your guys’ experiences in making cold brew?

Coffee,"What experiments or small changes have you been running with your coffee brewing? What have you been wanting to try, but just haven't got around to yet? I'm really curious!

I can start. I have a bunch of frozen Italian prune plums in my freezer and one day when making Japanese iced coffee (brewed over v60, I can provide my method/recipe if anyone is curious) I decided to swap out the ice cubes for whole frozen plum fruits as an experiment (and just for the fun of it). I realized as soon as I started pouring that the plums wouldn't function anywhere near as good as ice cubes. My drink ended up being not nearly as cold as it would be if I used ice, but it still turned out decent overall. It had the usual delicious coffee flavors, but with a bit of the added sweetness and acidity from the plum. Drinking out of a mug with a few whole plums in it wasn't ideal though. I think if I were to make changes to this experiment for a potential round two, I would make ice cubes out of the juice of whatever fruit I'm using, put those in the carafe, and perform the pour over as usual.

Coffee,"Hello!

I'm using a baratza Vario, ceramic burrs, single dosing freshly roasted coffee, with a 18g VST basket. The shots are good (although I find the Vario a nightmare to dial in, but that's for another post) so this is more of a curiosity.

When I see videos of people single dosing 18g, before they distribute it the ground coffee looks like a nice heap way above the edge of the portafilter.
But in my case, it doesn't really fill the basket that much.

Coffee,"Here is a general 'rule of thumb' process I use when tasting/experimenting with new beans. I have seen other mentioned similar ideas in comments, but wanted to formalize it a bit and get the community's take.

**Theory**

1. Extraction of coffee flavors happens three phases: sour &gt; sweet &gt; bitter.
2. Adjusting grind size, water temp, brew time, and dose are the most controllable ways to find this 'sweet spot'
3. Sour taste = under extracted
4. Bitter taste = over extracted

**Practice**

1. Brew new beans as you normally would (grind, temp, time) for your chosen brew method
2. Taste coffee.
3. IF TOO SOUR, play with adjustments to increase extraction:
   1. Smaller grind size
   2. Hotter water (c° increments up to 98C)
   3. Longer brew time (15s increments)
   4. Smaller dose (1g increments)
4. IF TOO BITTER, play with adjustments to decrease extraction:
   1. Larger grind size
   2. Cooler water (2° increments down to 80C)
   3. Shorter brew time (15s increments)
   4. Larger dose (1g increments)

Coffee,"Hi everyone. I make hot sauces for fun and I’m trying out a new recipe that involves coffee. 

I decided to try and infuse the vinegar that I plan on using in my next sauce with ground coffee. 

I put 30g of ground coffee in 400ml of white malt vinegar, and 30g ground coffee in 400ml of white wine vinegar

I heated the vinegar coffee mixtures on the stove until simmering, let them cool and have kept them in the fridge for a week to brew, stirring daily. 

However the coffee flavour isn’t very noticeable in the vinegars even after a week.

I had been drinking Turkish coffee but decided to try passing it through a sock like my relatives from Costa Rica use but I could only find these short flannel socks on a small wire hoop that I think comes from somewhere in Southeast Asia. My coffee comes out nice and strong like from a moka pot but much smoother.

1. I heat water to boiling and remove it from the heat. 
2. I stir expresso grind into the water and let it steep for three minutes. 
3. I pour the steeped coffee into a cup through the shallow flannel sock.

What is this method called? Is it associated with a certain place?

Coffee,"To give some background, I'm a software engineer in my late 20s. For the past year or two, I've been feeling the corporate world gradually chipping away more and more at my soul and my overall happiness. It's gotten to the point where I'm starting to take a step back and look more seriously at my career choices and how I want to spend 8+ hours of my day for the next 20-40 years. Specialty coffee has been a passion of mine for the past 8 years, and I'm more excited by it today than I ever have been. I love experimenting with different coffees and brewing methods, brewing it for myself and for others, learning about the supply chain and the different countries of origin, and introducing people to a side of coffee they've never seen before. With this in mind, I feel that working in coffee could truly be something that fulfills me and keeps me interested for the long run. I live a pretty simple life and I've built up a bit of a nest egg (been working towards FI for the past 5 years), so I'm not super worried about the monetary aspects of this change. I know I'll definitely be taking a pay cut, and I'd consider any role from Barista to Farmer. So my question to you all is this:

1. What part of the coffee industry do you work in?
2. Do you enjoy it?
3. How did you land in the role? Where did you first get your start in coffee, and what did the career path look like to get to where you are today? Who here works in the specialty coffee industry?

Coffee,"Hi, 

I don't doubt that this is well covered, but I can't see anything that precisely matches up to my criteria so wanted to ask.. 

I'm looking for a ""first proper grinder"" to move up from a cheap and nasty £40 one. A glance around my kitchen shows that I have a tendency toward simple, well built appliances that can be repaired rather than replaced. A Famag spiral mixer, a 1960s Kenwood stand mixer, a Moccamaster coffee machine etc.

Budget is maybe £150-250. In order of frequency, I use a Moccamaster, V60, Aeropress and a moccapot. No interest in the money pit that would espresso. My day to day preference is for medium roasts.

Obviously the first thought was a Baratza Encore or Virtuoso+. Simple and  well supported for home repairs. But are they as well supported for parts in the UK? Do they break more than others but people accept it because they are cheap (in the USA) to fix? Are there any other euro-centric options I should be considering?

Coffee,"I've had the Wilfa Uniform grinder for few years and I'm really enjoying it for the V60 I usually drink. I came across these burr alignment guides and decided to try this for the Wilfa - might just well get the best out of the grinder.
I used the whiteboard marker and foil shim method, and it was obviously [misaligned quite a bit](https://imgur.com/a/GMUElcF), I had to add maybe close to 0,5mm shim to get it as parallel as I could.



Burrs were clearly now more parallel, but the coffee I was getting was really bad. I usually grind at setting 18 and get a clear acidic cup, but now with adjusted alignment it seemed to produce way more fines throughout all the settings. I went trough settings 16-24 and every cup was quite muddy and all acidity was gone. Every time it created small chunks of super fine coffee.
It's no issue, I took the shims off and it's working great again. Mainly I'm puzzled why could this be? Might the burrset be designed with a bit crooked tolerances in mind or am I missing something?

Update:

So it turned out that my alignment was way off. Took me over two hours, but I managed to get it quite close to level now. For anyone curious, I used pieces of aluminum tape under the burr, 3 pieces of plastic from food packaging to center the burr and torque wrench that came with my bike to get even tightness.

Brewed a V60 from decaf now, and no signs of fines on the coffee bed and taste seems quite good. I'll get a better comparison tomorrow for my regular brew and once I get the grind setting dialed in. Thank you all for the help!

Coffee,"I am an owner of a 6 cup moka pot for almost a year.
I enjoy learning new tips in improving my moka pot experience. One of the debates I so often see is cleaning the moka pot. 

I will share on how I clean my moka pot which has been apart of my moka pot ritual besides grinding the beans and watching the coffee flow like a movie 🤣

After each brew, I will pour all the coffee in a carafe and immediately unscrew the pot to dump out the grounds and leftover water. Using a cloth and running water I wipe away all the parts where the coffee has flowed (gasket, filter, water chamber, filter basket and coffee collection chamber)

The next step is cleaning the interior of the coffee chamber spout AND the basket filter using a cotton bud or q tips. For the basket filter, it is a little tricky as I need to bend the cotton bud to create a weak point to allow it to bend into an L shape and wipe the hard to reach points. Its amazing how much coffee residues get stuck inside the basket filter (funnel and underside of the filter). Though many recommendations in soaking the pot in water and vinegar mixture, it doesn't exactly clean the hard to reach places as efficiently. 

Final rinse and wipe all parts with a dry cloth before putting on the rack to dry completely. The entire cleaning process takes about 15 minutes.

This may look tedious to many but this cleaning method has been part of my moka pot ritual and I get the satisfaction seeing a nice and shiny moka pot and not tasting rancid coffee in my coffee. The climate here is hot and humid all year round so I find it more prone for the coffee residuals in the moka pot to go rancid especially on occasions where I skip using the moka pot for a few days.

Coffee,"Hi hi, just as the title says, I'm looking for the best brewing ideas for someone who's disabled but also is broke af (I can't work while in school because my body can't handle the strain, so my budget is limited). I have multiple health issues including chronic pain, and although I've attempted the ""better"" brewing methods (pour over, French press, etc.) it's always so draining that I end up having to lie down and rest afterwards so my coffee gets cold before I can enjoy it, or my body starts to tremble in the middle of pouring/my vision starts to blur and I end up fucking up the brew anyway. So far I've been relying on the drip method using a cheap Walmart coffee maker, but I have really good beans that I love (thank you to everyone who gave me site recommendations last time; I've found beans that I adore thanks to y'all) and a fairly decent grinder so I want a better option than what I have. Are there budget options out there that don't require a ton of hands-on work? I really love coffee and don't want to give it up just because my body and bank account both hate me.

Coffee,"I've had a Niche Zero for about a year now, and have had some pretty good results making espresso. However, it has been a bit of a disaster for pourover. Looking at the grounds, I get a pretty inconsistent grind size, and the resulting coffee bed is covered in a thick layer of fines.

I've been using it with a V60 using Hoffman's recipe, as well as a Clever. Results are, unsurprisingly, better with the Clever, but there's still a lack of clarity and sweetness that *tastes* like inconsistent extraction.

I've had the grinder for a while and put a lot of coffee through it, so ""seasoning"" problems unlikely to explain it. I'm using the NFC disk, but removing it does not improve things. I'm also careful to run a bit of coffee through when switching from espresso to pour-over, and I went so far as to do a thorough cleaning of the whole grinder before grinding, to no avail.

I am beginning to wonder if I didn't re-install the burrs after cleaning properly, or something like that. Although, as I said, I have reasonably good results on espresso.

Coffee,"So, I thought it'd be time to pre-order a Flair 58. It's a sizable investment for a manual level machine, but I figured it'd be worth it if it would last along time and if upgrades would work for it in the future. But I just found out (through Flair's email support) that my original machine (bought in 10/2017) is no longer supported. That is to say, the upgraded portafilter platform that was available for it a couple of years ago is not longer being made.

Maybe I've been spoiled by other manufacturers who have kept parts and upgrades for every past model available (Baratza comes to mind), but Flair's failure to do this makes me think they consider older products to be disposable and unsupported. If I buy a Flair 58, will it also be unsupported or unupgradeable in 4 years? I thought being an early adopter would get me more support, not less.

I know there's a long tail inventorying problem when it comes to keeping parts for legacy products, but surely they could stamp out a few platforms for customers who don't want their classic Flairs in a landfill before their time. I'd willing to buy the bottomless portafilter and the 2 in 1 brew head if only I can also get the platform that was once offered for them. Surely, there's some kind of solution.

One would think they could scavenge a platform from some old classic Flair if they had to. Heck, just send an empty Neo frame for the price of a platform or something.

Coffee,"A friend of mine is interested in buying a Breville Grind Control for her morning drips - she currently drinks from K-cups. It seems like a decent machine but costs about 300$. Her primary concern is convenience, I suppose.

I imagine you'd be getting better quality for less money if you invested in something like a Wilfa or Baratza and any solid drip machine. But I could be wrong. My own setup from grinder to brew is totally manual, so I'm hoping someone here might be able to provide insight. Is the grinder on the Breville comparable? Is the extra outlay justified by the ease/consistency of brewing?

Any thoughts appreciated! :)

Coffee,"Hi everyone!  I used to be one of those Keurig people a few months back but recently I started getting into manual coffee and I gotta say it's much better tasting.  However, one of the things I've noticed is the difficulty in sourcing decent beans, especially given the state of the world right now (many coffee shops in my area are closed, with no information on when or even **if** they will ever reopen).

I didn't want to buy beans from the supermarket, who the heck knows when those were roasted - for all I know, they were roasted three months ago.  So I was left with only two options: online, or Starbucks (there's *always* a Starbucks nearby, it's practically ubiquitous).

Now I know that Starbucks coffee is known for being loaded down with two thousand kilograms of sugar and fifty million litres of cream, probably to cover up the heavily roasted and bitter nature of the beans that they use, which not only obliterate the delicate flavors that might have existed in their beans but also make the coffee very unhealthy to consume.

But I also know that they sell the beans that they brew, much like the smaller local coffee shops that used to exist where I live.  The only problem is, I have no idea if any of those beans are any good.  Are they closer to supermarket beans; roasted a half-century ago and left to rot on the shelf?  Or are they closer to coffee shop beans, purchased from the roaster a week or so ago?

Also, has anyone attempted to actually brew those beans before?  What quality did you get?  Are there any recommendations for what beans that Starbucks sells would be best for a pour-over style brewer (I use a Chemex)?

I was also considering purchasing online, directly from the roaster.  However, I will confess I have literally never done that before in my life, and I am honestly a bit overwhelmed by the choices available, and am not certain which coffee would be a appropriate for a Chemex brewer.  Should I do a lighter roast?  A darker one?  I'm a relative newcomer to the coffee world and there is a lot I still don't know.

Thanks for taking the time to help!  Hope everyone is healthy and safe out there, and happy brewing!

EDIT: Okay, well, from the responses I've been getting so far, it would seem that Starbucks beans are clearly not meaningfully better than the supermarket beans in terms of taste or quality.  In which case rather easily, the local roaster wins out.

My primary concern is that I might buy a bag of beans and not like the taste of the coffee that comes out of it - God what I would give to travel back to the halcyon days when you could go to a local coffee shop and buy a cup of that bean to taste before you buy.  Purchasing blind is a bit of a scary process so I'm hoping the roaster will offer a sort of ""safe"" bean that is perhaps not too funky in flavor and will give me a good starting point for comparison.

I have been informed that I should probably avoid beans that are too light (described as ""tea-like"") or have funky flavor descriptions (such as ""pineapple"" or ""beer""), because they might be too unusual and unexpected and a bit too much of a gamble flavor-wise.  I will get back to everyone once I've ordered my first bag, hopefully once I've brewed my first proper cup I'll have a better basis to start with.

Coffee,"I used a Timemore slim for my pourovers and felt two things were missing. One is the size - I wanted to grind more beans than 20-25g (depending on beans) and two, I felt there was another step in quality I may be missing out.

At the same time, I was very skeptical to how much my taste buds would be able to tell the difference between the slim burrs and other high quality hand grinders (I have shit taste buds). The reality after getting the C40 was a holy shit moment. I knew it could make a difference but it was a huge difference for me both with v60 and aeropress.

A few things I noted grinding with the C40 however.

-	The grinding experience wasn't great and especially not compared to Timemore slim. The grip and just how long it took me.
-	It was a lot messier compared to the slim. Coffee grounds were stuck in the grooves so when I unscrewed the jar, I would spill a bit on the table. This never happened with the slim. Maybe I'm doing something wrong?

All in all, the difference in taste made it absolutely worth the upgrade but am a bit disappointed at the full experience.

Coffee,"I am from Australia and recently bought a coffee machine for home.

Now I'm in the market to try some other beans and I was wondering if it is actually worth spending the buck on more expensive beans.

Coffee,"Ok.  We all waited for what 10-15 years for Melitta to produce a new version of the coveted Mill &amp; Brew that was such a great brewer.  My garage has a box of spare parts and carafes that has limped me along until right here - June 2021. 

My sister just remodeled her kitchen and unpacked the latest version - Melitta Aroma Fresh (MGB02)? Model I believe.  Instruction manual says printed 4/2018… I‘ve never seen until now.  Similar basic brew design… burr grinder now instead of blade which is better for beans.

She remembered the original model and was also excited but said coffee out of the box was brewing a little on the weak side even for Peet’s dark roast beans.   NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!

So here’s the problem… the beans get stuck when falling from the above hopper into the grinder on demand… how did Melitta miss this.  But I was determined to find a fix and I think we’re all going to be able to make the new model work!  Takes about 15 patient minutes to adjust.

Tools needed: 

(1) Phillips head screwdriver - medium sized and good quality that won’t easily strip the (5) screws you will be removing and reinstalling.

(3) 3/16” thick by 3/8” or 7/16” rubber o-rings - find these a good hardware store like ACE or good local non chain that has the wall of specialty metal drawers of tiny fittings.

Step 1:  Remove the bean hopper and empty.

Step 2: Sit down at a table, flip the hopper over and remove the black plastic door held to bottom of hopper with (4) SS Phillips head screws.  Keep all the parts on a paper towel nearby.

Step 3: (carefully) loosen without stripping the single SS screw that holds the burr guard to topside of bean hopper… it’s in there tight.  Screw looks pretty common and wouldn’t be hard to replace if you strip.

Step 4:  place the (3) O-Rings into the orifice to give the black plastic grinder safety guard a higher altitude / beans will now fall more easily!  Carefully replace and snug (but not over tighten) the single Phillips screw.

Step 5:  reattach spring loaded bean doors (easy) and reinstall (4) SS Phillips screws to secure bean door to bottom of hopper again.

Lastly:  Put bean hopper back on top of coffee machine, fill with beans and brew!  I’d keep the hopper bin off the lid and watch the beans fall for piece of mind the first time.

Coffee,"It's been pointed out that my wife and I are coffee snobs and after some thinking, I have to agree.  

The background, we're in Canada and we have been tea drinkers for most of our lives and have a good collection of loose leaf teas that we drink.   Up until 5 years ago, I could count the number of cups of coffee I had in a year on one hand.   Mainly for the caffeine fix and it was very much double sugar, double cream so it tasted like a coffee desert.  My wife thought of coffee as tasting like dirt mixed in hot water.

Some friends who buy green beans in bulk gave us some of their Yirgacheffe beans to try making a green coffee tea and my wife liked it.   They then suggested we oven roast it at 450F for 12 minutes until the cracking was in progress but not enough for the beans to get dark and oily looking.

The brewing method that we seem to have settled on liking the best is pour over onto ice.   65g of coffee, 300g of ice and enough water to make up a kg-ish of coffee.

We make a litre of it that goes in the fridge and we take small amounts and water it down for cold coffee beverages or straight as a warm drink.

No bitterness or sourness, I'd liken it tastes like a strong tea of fragrances from a wood working shop.

We tried something else from Honduras called Cafe Solar.   Tried light and then medium roasting.   The light had way too many flavours we didn't like.  Medium roasting improved it but it wasn't to our liking.  Flavours that seem pungent and overpowering.  

I'm watching videos of people talking about more exotic and expensive coffee, talking about fruit and herbs and spice notes.

We never thought we'd be in a state of mind to actually notice or be interested in some of these characteristics of coffee.

Coffee,"Coming from instant espresso, I'm an absolute beginner when it comes to coffee and I'm now on the fence between the moka pot and the Flair neo with a tight budget of HKD1000 (\~150USD). I personally enjoy milk drinks and tbh I dont have the highest standard for coffee, as I'm fine with the ones from starbucks. My concerns for the coffee maker are ease of use, consistency, quickness, ease of cleaning up, and small size, with the former ones being more important, and of course, producing lattes with a quality higher than, or at least on par with those from starbucks. (sorry if I'm asking for too much in this price range)

However, I have literally no extra equipment like grinder or kitchen scale, besides an electric kettle, and I plan to get my pre-ground espresso coffee (illy?) from supermarkets. 

So, between the above two, which of them would you recommend more to me? Feel free to leave suggestions other than the two of my options if you think they suit me more. Thanks in advance!

Coffee,"Hello everyone,

My trusty Poemia just gave out after about 7 years. It was an amazing machine especially for less that 100 CAD.

I am now looking at what my options are to go from here. I saw there are some automatic machines that seem to even automatically froth the milk. Like the Delonghi Dinamica. 

Are these worth the price? I am very good at making espressos, but when it comes to cappuccino or other more complex coffees, I'm not very good. So I see an advantage there for the automatic ones. But I am worried about the maintenance of these machines!! 

So I may just go with a more ""normal"" machine and a good grinder.

What are the go to machines these days?

I’ve got my hands on a vintage Tre Spade coffee grinder and I’d like to restore it to a point where I’d be able to use it. Not worried if it’s not repairable, I’d also love to have it on my display shelf!

Photos of all the bits I can take apart here https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1I-ezD8NPtDQXlrZVmuyv3WrMLP05i_OK

I think the problem is with the central shaft as the ridges along it have worn away. You can see that the hole where the shaft pokes through the handle is also worn, which is why the handle hangs at that angle. 

Does anyone have any clues to tackle this project? Or any places they’d be able to point me to get some more advice?

Coffee,"Hi

I just started getting into specialty coffee. Got a grinder, a french press, and some Ethiopian light roast beans from a local coffee roaster. I love the aroma and flavor, but the coffee was surprisingly thin and tea-like. I used 30g of coffee to 500g of water (\~1:16.66 ratio) like Hoffmann recommends in his video.

I'm grinding them medium, but I also tried grinding finer, without it making a huge difference in strength. What worked for me was using 30g of coffee to 370g of water instead (1:12.5 ratio).

My question is therefore: do you usually need more beans to water when brewing with a light roast bean if a strength similar to a dark roast bean is desired? Is light roast supposed to be thinner?",start getting specialty get grinder french press ethiopian light roast beans local roaster love aroma flavor surprisingly thin like use water ratio like hoffmann recommend video grinding medium also try grinding finer without making huge difference strength work using water ratio question therefore usually need beans water brewing light roast bean strength similar dark roast bean desire light roast suppose thinner
Coffee,"I wanted to share this story with people who might appreciate the absurdity of it. 

Last weekend my sister-in-law got married. My wife and I were going to be staying in a hotel for a week so we got a cheap hand grinder, a french press, and a scoop that was approximately equal to 10 grams of coffee. We figured that we could go without weighing everything for a week and just shoot for a cup that was better than hotel coffee

I normally tell people to go to a local roaster and buy direct so the beans are fresher but alas we ran out of time so we had to buy a bag from a grocery store (Allegro Kenyan single origin). On Saturday morning, my sister-in-law wanted all of us ready by 7:00 am and I was in charge of feeding my wife and her sister (the bride). I was rushing to make a couple of french presses for both of them and paid less attention than I had been to how much coffee I was using and how much water I poured in the french press. Offered the coffee to both of them and they both said they weren't feeling coffee so the cups sat in the car. 

12 hours later, the cups of coffee are still in the car untouched. My wife and I saw the cups of coffee on our way back to the hotel and we figured we might as well drink the coffee. We were exhausted but the reception was about to start so bad coffee sounded okay. I thought the coffee was going to be oxidized, stale and nasty.

But... it was the most delicious cup I have ever had. It was sweet with the perfect amount of acidity, and the perfect temperature!

&amp;#x200B;

My hypothesis is that since the cups were sealed and undisturbed, not much air got into the coffee. In addition, it was a 90 degree day so the coffee actually stayed at a perfect temperature.

Coffee,"I've had my eye out for a grinder upgrade for a while now to switch between espresso and pourover depending on which phase I'm in. The DF64/G-IOTA/Solo/whatever has caught my eye. It seems to be a mazzer that's been hacked and repurposed for single dosing which to me sounds fantastic for what I want to do. What intrigues me however is that people with experience with the best grinders in the world say this one makes good espresso, but not exceptionally great espresso.

My question is that if you take this grinder and mod it however you please (ssp burrs and alignment, etc) what are its limitations that separate it from producing coffee of the same quality as a lagom 64, monolith, ek43, etc? What variables are at play other than just the burrs? Is it rpm control? Burr size? User experience aside, what is the true difference in performance between a $500 flat burr grinder and a $1500 one if both have the best burrs you can put in them?

Coffee,"So when i got my v60, at first, it was like heaven. I got obsessed, the clarity and variety of flavours were insane. I ditched my old aeropress and left it to rot.

Then, I discovered I wasn’t extracting enough on the aeropress, so I got to work perfecting my recipe, and now it feels pretty perfect. Very similar coincidentally to the new Hoffman method, aha. I still like my recipe better (longer brew time by about a minute), seems to work better with my water and tastebuds.

I tried out my v60 again after probably 3 months of only aeropress, and the brew always came out watery and weak in comparison to the aforementioned brew method. 

Is this just a case of me preferring immersion vs percolation, or am I doing something wrong? If i grind finer, it just tastes astringent, not stronger.

Heres my v60 recipe:
15g coffee
30g bloom 45s
Pour up to 100g at the 1:15s mark
Pour up to 250g at the 1:45
Finish brewing ~ 3min

I have considered my grinder being a culprit, being a poor man who can only afford a hario smart g hand grinder, the grind distribution is obviously not great.  

Any tips on increasing strength without going over extracted? Maybe just reduce water and grind finer? 

For my aeropress i usually do 12:200, which is a much tighter ratio, maybe getting closer to that would be beneficial?

Coffee,"I'm at my wits end.

Bought a Venus about a week ago, ""cured"" it as per the instructions and watched every video I could find about how to make a decent cup with the thing. Still, every brew I make is gritty, full of particulate and tastes like burnt metal.

2: Should there be grounds in the remaining reservoir water after brewing? Each time I clean the Venus the water in the reservoir is brown and muddy with grounds floating around in there.

Coffee,"Hey all. Sorry if this question has been addressed before, but I have been wondering it for a bit. I hope that other lurkers here may find discussions that ensue on here useful.

I see a lot of posts/comments regarding redditors who get a new bag of beans and how they dial in their beans to fit their preferences. For users who go about this process, what does this process generally look like? Is this typically done in a cafe setting, or do you do it at home? I can understand this process being pretty ~~easy~~ streamlined when brewing espresso, when you can quickly brew a few shots back-to-back, but how do you approach dialing in beans for filtered coffee? Do you brew multiple cups in a day? Or does the process take several days?

Thank you for contributing and I hope this question brings valuable discussion.

Edit: I changed my use of ""pretty easy"" to ""pretty streamlined"" in terms of dialing in espresso. I meant to change that in my original post, but I forgot. I know dialing in espresso is not easy due to how sensitive espresso is to various controllable and uncontrollable factors.

Coffee,"Hello reddit. I'm fairly new to the world of coffee, only making the switch from starbucks to the good stuff within the last two years. I've been really enjoying the experience and taste of making specialty coffee and have gotten to the inevitable stage of wanting to try something new.

For context, I primarily use a French press that I grind typically dark roast beans for, and always drink black. I really like the textures and flavours I've been getting with immersion, but am open to something new (will be ordering some lighter roasts soon to give those a try). I also got into espresso a little while ago and have been really liking the whole process associated with that, so I enjoy being involved.

Tldr, I think I enjoy the body, texture, and slight bitterness I get with darker roasts in my French press.

I've started recently looking into pour over, most notably the V60 as that appears to be the method of choice for the majority of people. As someone with no experience and no one else to ask, I would love if you could offer your thoughts on any of my questions.



1: How different is say a V60 from a French press? My understanding is that the coffee will be ""smoother"" as the paper filters remove most of the oils and any coffee fines from the drink. Is the flavour that different?

2: Are darker roasts fine with pour over, or is it geared more towards lighter beans?

3: What pour over ""devices"" should I be looking at and what makes them distinct? I see some have ridges, others have flat sides and a lot are angled. What exactly is going on here?!

4: What are the differences with filter types? There's flat bottomed and conical ones, white and brown, wavy and non wavy. How do these differ?

4.5: The ""coffee sock"" seems interesting. I've read it lets through a lot more of the oils than a paper filter giving it more texture. Would this provide a similar brew to a French press?

5: How necessary is one of those fancy kettles? Will my $20 walmart one suffice, or do I REALLY need one with a long spout?

6: How hard is it to be consistent? My French press is fairly simple, just use a scale for the water and time how long it steeps. Can I expect a much more difficult experience with pour over?

7: Are there any resources you recommend to learn more? I have no friends or family that are coffee snobs so I mostly just google and hope for the best.

Coffee,"I'm in a bit of a pickle here. I'm used to buying my coffee at a local roaster and their coffee is usually overwhelming me with flavor the moment I open a bag. I actually quite enjoy the experience of smelling the beans.

Recently I ordered from a reputable roaster in Berlin, the coffee came in 3 days after supposed roast date, but it had almost no smell, or rather a very mild smell more akin to stale beans. It tasted alright (not even in the same ballpark as my local roaster, but I know I'm supposed to wait a week after roast date, so the taste might have not developed yet). Also the bloom wasn't as violent as usually with super fresh beans. I'm really confused, did they sell me stale coffee and marked it as fresh?? Should I complain to them? Or am I just being paranoid?

Update:

I contacted the roaster and their reply was ""our coffee was roasted on the day it says on the bag"". I was really confused with this reply since it didn't really address any of my concerns.

As suggested by some commenters this might happen with lighter roasts. So the only thing left to do is to wait a couple of days and see how the taste develops and if its gonna be better. Have you ordered freshly roasted coffee that didn't ""smell"" fresh?",bit pickle use buying local roaster usually overwhelm flavor moment open bag actually quite enjoy experience smelling beans recently order reputable roaster berlin come days suppose roast date almost smell rather mild smell akin stale beans taste alright even ballpark local roaster know suppose wait week roast date taste might develop yet also bloom violent usually super fresh beans really confuse sell stale mark fresh complain paranoid update contact roaster reply roast day says bag really confuse reply since really address concerns suggest commenters might happen lighter roasts thing left wait couple days see taste develop gonna better order freshly roast smell fresh

Coffee,"I enjoy a coffee once or twice a day, using a Baratza Encore with an Aeropress. I usually have 1 Teaspoon of sugar and a glug of milk. 

It seems a lot of hardcore coffee drinkers take it black. I do occasionally have it black, but I just enjoy it more with sugar and milk.

Should I be trying to make the change? 

I know it would be slightly healthier, but does your taste change to properly appreciate it with nothing added?

**Edit**: so this post kind of exploded a lot more than I expected it to lol. Thanks for all the responses, I'm reading them all. The distinct impression I'm getting so far, is to drink it how you like it, but making the switch to black might help me appreciate nice beans more.

Coffee,"My stab at explaining Gale's coffee rig from Breaking Bad. This is an initial take only, but I'd be interested in recreating the process implied in this scene. I get that this isn't a real setup and doesn't have perfect verisimilitude. But, something like this DOES seem feasible, at least. The first problem I see is lack of insulation in the container. Gale says he maintains a temp no higher than 92º C. I can see how a vacuum will lower the boiling point temp, but why is that beneficial? Does he have to boil at all?

Coffee,"Hi all!

(Tldr below)

My dad and I spent about a decade being fancy coffee people. Over the years both of us have drifted back to plain ol basic cheap stuff. At some point there seemed to be a lot less diversity at all the local coffee roasters and at the end of the day there's something nice about a big ol pot of crap coffee haha.

Anyways. 

Periodically though my dad will order some mocha java beans. It is one of our favorites. Problem is none of the brands seem to have the trade mark punch we could find 10-20 years ago. Best we've been able to find has a little of the flavor but is very underwhelming. 

Idk if this is some barista BS, was probably almost 15 years ago at this point, but they guy told us that the place mocha java traditionally came from wasn't being used as a bean source as much so we'd see less and less of what we were looking for. Indeed it turned out to seem true over the years. 

He would make an a blend for us that was really close. Don't exactly remember what it was but i think it was a mix of Kenya AA and Peaberry or maybe Yerggicheff and Sumatra. Or a mix of any of those haha.

I would really love to find a quality bag of whole bean stuff for him. The local roasters can't help me out so thought I'd ask yall coffee heads.

Tl;DR: Whats a good brand for Mocha Java beans?

EDIT: he's tried Pete's, the blend from Nuts, Mayorga, HWC and other those its been from regional places in Dayton and Cincinnati.

Coffee,"Given that refractometers are prohibitively expensive (DM me if you have schematics / links to DIY projects towards building your own), I was slightly disappointed when I realized I couldn't carry out the following experiment:

Tools: Refractometer, pH test strips, the dripper of your choice, and at least 4 coffee cups (or mugs, or something that said dripper can fit over).  


The test:

1. Line up the cups in a row
2. Place the dripper on the first cup
3. Start brewing
4. Move the dripper to the next cup after X number of seconds. X being your total target brew time divided by the number of cups.
5. Test each cup

The goal here is to see how each 'chunk' of brew time goes on to affect sugar and acidity. Additional questions arise such as what is the affect of agitation? Which chunks of time are particularly affected by grind size? Etc.  


Also - I specifically created a reddit account to post this so...be nice :)

Coffee,"I come to this subreddit as a non-coffee drinker, in hopes that I may partake of your wisdom.

My mother loves her coffee, especially in the morning, though she actually prefers drinking decaf.  It's not the caffeine hit she wants, just the warm beverage. Currently, she owns a reasonable coffee machine (I believe it is referred to as an ""auto-drip"") and a nespresso machine where she can get an espresso if she's having a long workday.

My question is as follows: I have found a little device called a Moka pot that is supposed to make fantastic coffee, albeit with a bit more legwork than a standard machine.  I am wondering whether this would be a good birthday/holiday gift in the future, but as she already has a perfectly fine coffee machine that depends largely on how much better coffee with a Moka pot is.

So how much better is the coffee made in a Moka pot?  Is it worth the extra effort? And should it have a place in her kitchen?

Edit: thank you guys for the insight and the other suggestions.  I'm going to discuss some of these with my dad and see what will probably work best.

Have any of y'all ever seen this behavior before?

As the title says, I just got a new job as a barista, and I'll be starting training later this week. I worked as a barista for a few months at the end of 2020, and had all the basics down-- I could make all the classic espresso drinks, and do some very very basic latte ""art"". However, it's been a good amount of time since then, and I also wasn't a barista for very long... but I think my new employer thinks I know more than I actually do.

I am confident in my abilities currently to pull shots, make iced drinks, differentiate between drinks (after brushing up on them a bit). However, I am very worried about a few thing. Mainly, steaming the milk-- at my old shop, I used a thermometer for steaming to ensure I got it right, and I think our steam wand was easier to use then most are-- for ours you turned the dial all the way, but having used a different machine once I spilt milk everywhere when turning the dial that far.

I also was never trained on how to dial in shots, so I definitely don't know how to do that haha

I'll be receiving training at the new job, but feel I should have more of a base level of knowledge than I currently do. Does anyone have any tips&amp;tricks, good resources, or videos to watch that can help me?

Thanks in advance! Help!

Coffee,"Hey guys, in need of a couple advices here. 

I'm currently using a Spaziale S2 at work and I recently noticed a big difference in the quality of my espresso. I get no texture, no thickness/body, a really unbalanced espresso which is either really acidic or bitter and most of the time, there is a really strong burnt flavor. 

So first I deep cleaned my grinder and my coffee machine thinking that the old coffee ground and cafeol were the reason for that burnt  flavor. But even after that, still a bad taste.

I tried several ""calibration"", finer/corser grind, more or less grams, same problem.

Another thing to know is that the S2 steamwand lacks power so i had a technician change the press switch (Google translate here, pressostat in my language) so that I'd get more pressure to properly froth my milk (were serving a lot of  cappu/latte/hot chocolates here). On the other hand though, the global temperature of the machine is going up so I have to peoperly flush my groups before extracting my espressi to lower the temp and avoid any risk of burning my coffee.

Last thing I noticed is that my pressure gauje is never above 8/8.5 bars when I'm extracting. Is that a problem as well? I always had 9 bars and I'm wondering if this could have anything to do with a weak, watery espresso?

In short, I'm wondering if not enough pressure+ high temp = burnt floaty coffee.

I'm kind of lost, I've been working in the coffee industry for years and it is the first time I'm struggling that much. I can't stand the fact that I'm serving this product to my customers and I'd love to find a reason to why my espresso went from perfectly fine to absolutely awful in the span of a week...

Ah, also, the coffee machine sita right behind a big window, and I'm living on an island, so the sun is pretty harsh here. Could that also be a reason to why my machine is distributing extra hot water?

Coffee,"I usually make a smoothie in the morning consisting of frozen bananas, peanut butter, oats, chocolate protein powder, water and ice. It felt like groundhogs day as I was putting this together for the zillionth time. Anyway I saw the Aeropress sitting in that dish drying thing next to the sink; so I pressed 19g of stump town hair bender to 100 ml water, ground medium fine (14 on the encore) with a good 40 seconds of stirring. I added it to the smoothie aaand... Wow! If you drink a protein shake in the morning or afternoon and hate your life I highly recommend this recipe. The Aeropress coffee recipe really helps with the taste. I think a medium to dark roast would have worked  even better.

Coffee,"Short version: we tested coffee brewed with tap water (pH 8) and reverse osmosis water (pH 6.4) and liked the pH 6.4 water better.  I don't want to do RO all the time, and I'm asking you all for alternative ideas to drop water pH for brewing.  Thanks!

More details below.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Today we compared tap water coffee made with tap water (left to sit out for 1-2 days, to blow off chlorine) against coffee made with water filtered through a home reverse osmosis tap.  

My home water had a moderate hardness at 7.0 grains/gal.  The pH was about 7.5 or 8 (which surprised me). His RO water had a hardness less than 1. The pH was \~6.4 - close to the pKa of carbonic acid (as expected). In parallel, we brewed two cups of grocery store dark roast coffee (medium/fine grind, 18g/300 mL 85 degree C water) in Hario V60 drippers. 

To my surprise, 3/3 of us (two blinded) liked the coffee made with RO water better.  It was cleaner tasting and had an aroma with more flowery notes and caramel.  The regular tap water tasted a bit muddy and had a dirtier mouth feel.   The aroma was lacking.    

I am an electrolyte physiologist, and I have written scientific papers on the numerous health benefits of minerals, including magnesium, that are in tap water.  Coffee and tea are my main sources of drinking fluid, and I am loathe to use RO water for my regular coffee.  I suspect much of the aroma difference is due to the lower pH of the RO water, though I agree that the difference in mouth feel could have been related to the water hardness. 

My question for the community is how can I reduce the pH of my water for coffee without using RO or imparting some terrible taste (from adding most household acids)? Water hardness, pH, and coffee.

Coffee,"Due to the demands of a pretty hard major, I used to drink coffee solely for the caffeine and would drink anything I could get my hands on without discrimination.

I started getting more into making my own coffee after being at home for the past year and a half and have played around with a couple of brewing techniques (aeropress, V60, french press). Up to this point, I have been using the house blend from costco with a smart grinder pro and the coffee I make in the morning is better than anything I would have previously bought (Starbucks/McDonalds/7-11).

I recently saved up some money to try out a locally roasted beans from a decently reviewed roaster. I tried all 3 brewing techniques and did side by side comparisons. Given that these are over 3x the price and quite hyped, I was expecting to be blown away by the flavor, however, in all fairness, perhaps my expectations were unrealistic.

Side-by-side, the costco beans were a little bit more bitter but I honestly found it so slight that I did not find an extremely perceptible difference between the two.

Is there something I am doing wrong or do I just have a screwed up palate?

Coffee,"For context, I have a Niche Zero that I use for all my coffee grinding. This morning, I made an espresso which I ground at the 7 setting. At 3pm I wanted to make my pre-workout filter coffee. I had everything set up and preheated, chucked my beans in, turned on the grinder, and realised it was still at 7 instead of 41.

I figured the best thing I could do to save was is to change my filter papers to the Cafec TH-3’s, (which promote medium high-high flow rate) and brew with more aggresive pouring to promote high agitiation. The result was a surprisingly drinkable cup, slightly higher body and lower acidity but still very aromatic. I was curious as to what other coffee people would have done instead.

Coffee,"Hey guys. I've been lately concerning myself with philosophical coffee questions, which led me to wonder: What's the definition of a traditional espresso? 

Up until now, I thought it was about 50-60 mL for a double shot (pretty straightforward right?) made with 15 grams of coffee. But then came in the so-called brewing ratios that I didn't really know applied to espresso too. I saw somewhere that espresso is really defined by that sort of ratio (something like 1:2 or 1:3) rather than volume. But where does that leave traditional 50-60 mL espresso? If we use the traditional 15 grams to pull a shot like that then we get a ratio like 1:4 which is contrary to what I mentioned above.

Coffee,"**I'll start:** I ran out of oat milk for cappucinos yesterday, so I decided I would brew a French press for a nice change of pace. Instead of using our Cuisinart burr grinder (not great) I decided to adjust the dial on the JX-Pro and use that instead. 

First problem: I needed 50 grams of coffee, which required two separate grinds since the JX can only fit about 25-30 grams. No big issue - got through the first batch and put it into the French press, and made it 90% of the way through the second batch before disaster struck. I was tilting the grinder to ensure that all of the beans had made it through, when the handle flew off the top. The metal crank landed directly on the edge of the glass French press, cracking it and dropping shards of glass into the coffee bed. Not much to salvage there.

Since the French press plan was clearly not happening, I decided to brew a V60 instead. I adjusted the grind and made it all the way through the brew process before realizing I had used an espresso blend instead of the Costa Rican single origin that I wanted to use - I didn't think it would make a big difference in the final cup, but boy was I wrong. After 15-20 minutes of suffering, I dumped my V60 brew and had a diet Coke instead.

Coffee,"I’ve been using a moka pot for years and have been upping my game this year. Breville barista express for Christmas but I don’t always want espresso. I just ordered a Breville precision brewer but now I need a grinder. I was hoping for some advice.

From low to high price points, I’ve been looking at the Bartaza encore, Breville smart grinder pro, and the Bartaza Virtuoso. I use the grinder on the barista express for my espresso but I like the idea having one grinder for everything. Reviews seem kind of mixed as to how well each grinder works for brewed coffee versus espresso.

Any personal experiences/opinions?

Edit: Wow! This has been quite an education. I had honestly not even considered hand grinders mistaking them for cheap alternatives. For my price point, they really do seem like the superior choice.

Coffee,"Quick question - Can the roast of a coffee play a part in how quickly the drawdown phase of a v60 takes? I've been using the Hoffman technique for a while now, with great results. Recently, I bought some decaf beans from another supplier. I now can't get a V60 to complete in less than 5:30 using the same technique that I use for my caffeinated beans.

Coffee,"Hey! Sorry for format  I'm on mobile. So, I'm a barista at a coffee shop and Im heading home over the weekend by plane (I currently live about five states away) and I would love to bring my coffee fanatic father the ten extra pounds of coffee I have sitting in my house, but I heard stories of coffee getting dumped at the airport. It's all prepackaged/sealed beans (so no powder) but Im still slightly worried it would be dumped (it's about 100 USD worth of coffee roughly). Any tips/tricks or advice for what I should do? I could always send it by mail, but the cost for that will be awful (it looked to be over twenty just based on the poundage of the bags). Thanks!

Coffee,"Hi guys, 

I make a pot of coffee every morning in my Bonavita Connoisseur, typically using around 50g of coffee at a 1:15 ratio. I grind in my Baratza Encore, sometimes the night before depending on how early I'm getting up. 

I've noticed that to get the best results for my taste buds, I consistently grind around a 13 on my Encore on darker roasts, whereas I find myself going to 15/16 on lighter roasts. When I go any finer for light roasts I get channeling and overall uneven extraction, and conversely when I go any coarser for dark roasts there is a pronounced lack of strength/flavor. 

I am very happy with my results, I'm just curious if this has occurred for anyone else? I would think that light roasts should taste better when ground more finely than dark, and yet here I am :) Does anyone else get better results grinding coarser for lighter roasts?",guys make pot every morning bonavita connoisseur typically using around ratio grind baratza encore sometimes night depend early getting notice get best results taste buds consistently grind around encore darker roasts whereas find going lighter roasts finer light roasts get channel overall uneven extraction conversely coarser dark roasts pronounce lack strength flavor happy results curious occur anyone else would think light roasts taste better ground finely dark yet anyone else get better results grinding coarser lighter roasts
Coffee,"Normally, I grind between 15-17 on my Encore and get good and consistent extraction with most Central American light-medium blends, using a ceramic Kalita Wave, about 3:15-3:45 brew times.  

I've recently tried new beans, Kenya Giakanja.  I'm getting very long brew times but it's also not tasting over-extracted or bitter.  I've played around with grind sizes between 13-17, tried ceramic Kalita and Beehouse drippers.  Toward the end of the brew the water is barely trickling through the filter resulting in 6:00 brew times.  I assume the fines are choking the holes...?  I have to lift up the filter to ""release"" the water.  The strange thing is that I'm not tasting bitterness or over-extraction.  

I'm not familiar with African beans, nor do I have a good understanding of the science behind everything.  My guess is these beans are more soluble so it's expanding more or creating more ""density,"" hindering consistent flow...?  I suppose I can't complain if I'm not getting poor results, but I'm not getting great results either.  Using my Aeropress with the Giakanja I'm getting much better and more consistent results using similar methods and grind size as my usual Central American blends (I typically use my Aeropress as my ""control"" for coffee experimentation).  I just don't know if these extremely long brew times or bean behavior is expected with these beans.

Coffee,"I've been using my Aeropress with the ol' reliable inverted method for months without any issues. After switching to Hoffmann's recent perfect Aeropress technique I always get grounds in my coffee after filtering. The filter seems to slip (for the lack of a better word) which makes a small amount ground pass through the gab. See phot. Anybody got any idea on how/why that happens or what I could do to prevent? I'm not pressing very hard, that would have been the only thing I personally thought of before posting it on here.

Coffee,"This post is mainly just to share my love of the Clever Dripper and encourage everyone who hasn’t tried it to go pick one up. 

I have a few different coffee brewers (drip machine, Hario V60, Mocha pot etc) but honestly the Clever produces the most consistently great cup of coffee, full of flavour and zero fuss. Using the James Hoffmann method (link below) makes it super simple. 

It’s relatively cheap at around £20 depending on where you get it. I’m not a coffee expert, far from it, but as an amateur coffee enthusiast who just wants a great cup of coffee I would definitely recommend picking one up.

Coffee,"Hola humans

Was thinking to buy my 1st espresso machine, have been making (and enjoying) my own coffee for the past 18months now (thanks to the pandemic).

Did french presses, and Mokapots, V60 and latest addition is Aeropress.

However, I am now missing badly my favourite of them all (Cappucinos or Cortados because I am fancy like that)

Thus I have been researching for about 3 months now on which espresso maker I should go.

Criterias:
1. It has to be a long term investment, which means budget is somewhat flexible (below $1,500 please)
2. It should be good for 2 shots a day (morning and afternoon) 
3. It should be future proof (can grow alongside me as a better espresso maker), which means entry machine is a no go because I think I will just waste money upgrading after 2 year or so
4. Ability to steam milk (nothing too crazy like super wand power etc., normal steaming is good enough I am not trying to be a barista)

Some products I am considering:

1. La Pavoni Levers (not sure which type yet)
2. Lelit gang (Elizabeth / Mara X)
3. Other recommendations ?


Currently I am leaning towards Pavoni for 2 main reason(s)
1. I heard it is built like a tank ( won't need to recycle for decades hopefully)
2. I like the simplicity since it's manual (less things to maintain etc.)

Coffee,"Lately, I've really been enjoying the offerings from Central American countries. Its been a steady realization of mine that the flavor profile from this region might be my favorite of any coffee growing region.  I bought an Ecuador a few weeks back from a local roaster, [Crema Coffee](https://crema-coffee.com), that was incredible to brew at home. Chocolaty, but with a hint of some florals. My favorite coffee of all time was a Honduran coffee from the Portland roaster [Coava](https://coavacoffee.com). It was brewed with a Clever, and was unforgettably sweet. I tend to enjoy Panamanian coffees as well. The reason for the post is to pose a few questions.

1. I'm not sure my palate is sophisticated enough to really discern what it is about these coffees that I find pleasing. Though in general, I like a more ""medium"" roast profile that still carries  complex characteristics that make it interesting. Maybe there are some fruit or floral notes to accompany a more traditional chocolate/nut profile. Also, it may be that I've falsely grouped the coffee in Central American countries as having a similar flavor profile. Do you feel as though coffee from this region has similar flavor characteristics, and if so, how would you describe them?
2. Does it happen to be the case that Central American coffees are in season right now? Perhaps that is why I have developed a fondness for them lately.
3. For those in the industry: Is there a trend towards increased development and interest in specialty coffee growing in Central America? I sure hope that farmers in this region find it increasingly worth it to grow specialty. Count on me to continue buying. 

Thanks in advance for the input!

Edit:
As u/officialsnaxolotl correctly pointed out, by including Ecuador in my favorites above, I should more accurately broaden the region by saying Latin America.

Coffee,It seems my Ratio Six may have a problem and I’m wondering if this is just my unit or a design flaw. What’s going on is the spray head tends to “spray” back toward the water tank and not come out much on the front of the spray head. It sprays back so much that if I don’t have the heat ring on it sprays out toward the water tank and completely misses the coffee basket altogether from the holes closest to the water tank. I’m wondering if this is a problem with my unit or others have the same issue. I only noticed it when I began to use their glass carafe with the unit and then took off the heat ring to see if the same thing happened.

Coffee,"And wow it's good. 

For background, my wife exclusively drinks tea. I was grinding up my beans this morning for my pour over when the wafting aroma of loose leaf black tea hit me right in the face. Just smacked me real good. So I thought, ""Dang I want some of that. But I also want my coffee. What am I to do?"" And so I was like ""screw it"" and threw some loose leaf tea into my V60. I then dumped my ground coffee beans on top of that and proceeded to brew as normal.

I was honestly surprised. I thought the coffee would just overpower the tea but it didn't. This tea has a lot of flavors of vanilla in it, so it worked well with the fruity light roast I'm drinking currently. I will most likely make this my daily driver from now on. Just thought I'd share with y'all and happy brewing!

The bubbles start rising, but at a steady rate, not the usual stops and starts.  Water was dripping steadily into the filter basket instead of spurting.

Hopefully this post makes sense for /r/coffee but I’ve seen the topic of coffee grounds composting come up a few times in comments, specifically compositing for apartment dwellers. If you’re in the US, municipalities rarely offer a food waste compositing stream. One option for dealing with this is vermicompost . Vermicompost is basically just using worms to accelerate the breakdown of organic matter and you can do it indoors. I’ve been using this method for well over decade at this point, through many apartments and was even doing it in my dorm room (yeah I was that kid).

Worms love coffee grounds, coffee filters (paper), tea bags, moldy bread, junk mail (non-glossy paper), egg shells, plant cuttings, fruit and veggie waste. No meat, dairy products, or very oily stuff though (smell issues). 

You get some great dirt (worm castings) out of it that you can incorporate into the soil you use for your indoor plants/raised beds/community plots/dump it at a local park. You will also get a liquid fertilizer out of the excess moisture (I call it worm juice) which is fantastic for any food pr.

It doesn’t have to take too much investment to get started. You can just use a rubber made type container and poke/drill some holes in the lid, although you will have to be diligent removing/controlling excess moisture. Despite the cost, I do recommend one of the tray/tiered systems you can get as it is just easier to deal with everything.  I have used the “Worm Factory” for probably close to 10 years and haven’t had an issue.  You won’t have to worry about them escaping as worms don’t like light so they say put unless you don’t feed them or flood them out. I’ve always used red wigglers. You need roughly double the weight in worms as the amount of food waste you create in a day (~1-2lbs person).  You don’t have to buy that many to start as they will make worm babies overtime, you’ll just have to meter the amount of food waste you give them until the catch up. 

I’ve included some photos of my worms/worm bin, for the curious, that are currently handling the waste of a family of six (three adults and three small children) which is about the limit of that setup without adding more trays. The worms are currently handling ~80gr+ of coffee/day. They aren’t in my kitchen (in my garage) anymore because of said children which constantly want to play with them or probably eat them. There are tons of good information/how toos on the internet if you want more detailed information but I am happy to answer questions.

Coffee,"I decided I wanted to try an unpressurized filter basket in my Delonghi ECM155M, but without modding the original portafilter in the process.

I discovered a lot of confusion on the internets about what size the filter baskets are, what fits, and what models to search for.  to make it worse, the information about basket size for the EC155M that I kept finding varied wildly.

[""The consensus on this is that the portafilter uses a 52mm basket""](http://www.espressochronicles.com/equipment/best-espresso-machine/delonghi-ec155/)

[""51mm basket""](https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/hu0qph/delonghi_ec155m_portafilter_basket_size/)

49mm (old) or 51mm (new) according to this [portafilter size chart](https://portafilter.net/portafilter-size-chart/)

Google even [tells you in a snippet that it uses a 52mm basket](https://www.google.com/search?q=EC155M+Basket+size) if you search for it.

but when I finally just measured the basket, it appears to be a 54mm basket.

Coffee,"Hey everyone.. i need some education from you if you may for being in the coffee world more than me (i\`m a newbie). I want to ask about GRIND Size. 

What i see that GRIND is not consistent on the internet on how to measure the grind size and make sure you have a pretty good grind for what you are using..  


I\`ll take this as an example (images shown below)

COARSE is defined around 1400 to 1600 nm.  
But if you take a look at the below, you will see that visually I'm not able to see how these are close to each other.... some even look like they do not have coffee particles at all.

Coffee,"Hello all, long time lurker here.

I've recently bought a Skerton Pro and have only used it for grinding around 20g of coffee for about 10 times.

Starting my 4th time grinding (after having problems with my brew in a moka pot), I started dialing it from zero to 6 to 8 clicks in every use and cleaning it after (removing the inner burr and brushing off the remains).

Today I was grinding normally, set at 6 clicks, and when finished I noticed that the grind was really fine (powdery fine).  I tried to remove the burr and it was stuck.

After trying to remove the burr, I noticed that the problem was the burr holder.  I managed to remove it and the holder looks warped (it is made of plastic), like the shaft moved and lost its position inside the holder.

Coffee,"If you've ever lived in Texas, you have definitely heard of [H-E-B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-E-B). It's a very popular chain of grocery store known for its brand loyalty within TX. It's my go-to place for groceries in town: great selection of meats, cheeses, wine; produce is fresher compared to other stores; snack selection is more varied; and HEB has its own generic version of everything. 

One of these generic version is coffee. Branded under [Cafe Ole](https://www.heb.com/cafe-ole-mch), there are different lines of **flavored** coffee. I've always been curious to see how all the flavors compare with each other but haven't been able to find a good review. So here is my attempt.

Note: I am comparing only the Taste of Texas line of coffee (the orange bags), which are based on different regions/cities of Texas where you can find an H-E-B store. Unfortunately no flavor for DFW or El Paso area. Lubbock opened a new HEB location last year and I managed to get my hand on a bag of Hub City flavor (which I can't find online).

&amp;#x200B;

Cupping method: Followed James Hoffman's method. 

Grinder: 1zpresso Jx, 1.8 turns. Fine medium-fine.

Coffee/water: 15 g coffee and 150 g Hill Country Spring Water (HEB brand) brought up to a boil. Break crust after 4 min, begin tasting after 5 min.

All these coffees are advertised to be medium roast. 

**Taste of Hub City (aka Lubbock)**: This was my second time tasting Hub City. The first time I thought it tasted like burnt rubber, which I thought was amusing, taking the ""Hub City"" label so literally. In my second taste in comparison with the other flavors, it wasn't that bad. Nothing special. Not too bitter, not too acidic, no interesting flavors, medium body. Generic. Sort of like decent gas station coffee. Which is still fitting since people usually drive through Lubbock anyways. The kind you drink when you're in a pinch. Would go well with good milk and sugar.  Recommend this for late-night studying session, if you can get a hold of them.

**Taste of San Antonio**: HEB's headquarter is in San Antonio. All of HEB's product is shipped from San Antonio. Ironically, this is my least favorite flavor. Perhaps it's my preference for lighter roast. Incredibly thick mouthfeel. The first thought I had when the coffee hit my mouth was ""Baked goods?""--like the Mexican pastries which are very popular in San Antonio, but it was so thick and heavy, almost toasted/burnt. Too heavy to be caramel-like. Toffee, maybe? A bit of cinnamon. Not acidic, more bitter. But man, did it feel ""heavy."" The heaviness reminded me off the times I went out for Tex-Mex dinner and had a food coma 30 min later. Would do well as dessert coffee or a base for Vietnamese egg coffee. Absolutely would not drink as a standalone drink imho but this is my personal preference speaking.

**Taste of Houston**: So light in comparison to San Antonio that I wondered if I got a stale batch. Most floral out of all of them. At times lavender-like. Almost like a floral perfume, bordering on fake but not quite. Interesting, to say the least. Some acidity for brightness. Overall, pleasant. I could drink this by itself.

**Taste of Rio Grande**: Bright. I was surprised by the acidity that hit my mouth with the initial sip, especially after tasting Houston. More fruity than Houston. Some floral notes, but the fruitiness is stronger. Not as light. Maybe sweet? My favorite out of the bunch. I like fruity coffee. I can drink this for my morning coffee.

**Taste of Austin and Taste of Hill Country**: These are two separate flavors but are very similar to each other. First sip of Hill Country made me backtrack, wondering if I was tasting chemicals. Almost perfume-bleach like? The flavors later developed into cinnamon. Hill country had a sharper cinnamon taste, the kind that's almost acrid/astringent (like accidentally snorting cinnamon up your nose) while Austin had a more mellow, rounder, ""heat"" of cinnamon flavor. But neither are very acidic. Both are medium-heavy body. I would pair these with a pastry, like a chocolate croissant, but not drink by itself. I didn't like the cinnamon flavor. 

&amp;#x200B;

Overall impression: My coffee palate is adequate at its best, needs improvement at its worst. I've tried to be as descriptive as possible. I know flavored coffee is not usually preferred, but if you're every driving through Texas and you want to try some interesting coffee flavors, stop by HEB. Or just buy some HEB snacks (the Cowboy cookies are great). Interesting experience for my palate. I might drink Rio Grande regularly if my grinder can tolerate it. All the beans were quite oily on appearance and I gave my 1zpresso a good brush after all the grinding.

Coffee,"OK, so finally I bought myself a good hand grinder. I already got an encore, but now I purchased the JX non pro. So far, so good. I love the machine and the grind consistency is superb. But... After 5 test cups (got the JX yesterday) I still can't seem to find the sweet spot for my size 1 V60. I know, keep grinding finer or coarser till you hit that spot, but I really would like a rough guide for the range I should be grinding in. I'm now mostly grinding between 60 to 75 clicks from zero, for now. So that's 2 full rotations from zero and then some more. Both ends of that range, which is also recommended by 1zpresso, give me an underwhelming cup and below 60 clicks the coffee was really bitter. I use fresh and good quality light roast beans. Also just a little darker roast from the same roaster. They are expensive though, so the sooner someone can guide me in the right direction the better.
 So V60, 15:250, 30s bloom 45 grams water, then 1 continuous, slow pour up to 250 grams. Total brewtime is between 1:45 and 2:30. With the encore I got decent coffee this way.

Coffee," 

OK, I'll start this off by swearing I'm better than this, but this machine has me stumped. I have tried to follow the two links below, but cannot get the damn steam control via the alarm function to work.

[My major DIY upgrade to my Gaggia Classic - PID, Steam, Boiler Boost : Coffee (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/16ucv0/my_major_diy_upgrade_to_my_gaggia_classic_pid/)

[Steam control using single setpoint PID (skenedesign.com)](http://www.skenedesign.com/Silvia/)

I'm using an old blackberry USB charger to power the alarm circuit, but I'm finding the adapter is always hot. I can't find a switched post on the front switch panel. I swear I've had cases where the steam t-stat isn't live when I measure voltage from the neutral to the single blue wire on the steam t-stat, but once I hit the brew button, it's live from then on, and I can't always replicate it, so I tend to think there is some user error going on. So when I do have output USB connection connected to the adapter, it definitely doesn't stick to my 216 sv temp setting for the brew. I think I'm tying into the circuit incorrectly somehow.

When I disconnect the steam t-stat nothing happens, heat wise, because that circuit needs to be completed for the heating element I think, but when I do connect it, the brew temp control doesn't really work the same, it triggers when it gets below 216 and then bounces to 235 and just keeps doing that. It's not like it settles like it did before I started futzing with it.

I tried to diagram out how I have it wired now in case someone sees something obvious I'm doing wrong. Thanks in advance, it shouldn't be this hard!

Coffee,"Hi fellow coffee snobs,

I have a question I'm curious to get some answers on. We're always told grind freshness is key to flavour, but what about the quality of that grind?

I'm currently overseas and using my travel setup - aeropress &amp; porlex mini.

It's no secret the porlex is not the best handgrinder ever created and I'm definitely noticing in the cup, but at least I'm grinding fresh right.

The cafe I've been buying my beans from has offered to grind the beans for me using an EK. 

This got me thinking, what would be better?

A. Grinding fresh using my porlex
B. Having cafe grind whole bag using EK

Stats:

250g bag of beans generally between 7 - 14 days off roast

Light roast

I use between 24 - 36g of coffee a day

Aeropress only

I still have the smooth texture lingering in my mouth. I could taste the notes of the coffee exactly how the roaster described them to be, a dark roast, nutty coffee with an after taste of cocoa. 

I am amazed how inexpensive the entire process turned out to be as well. I'm so excited to try some medium roasts in the Clever next and see if I can get some fruity sweetness.

Coffee,"Hi,

So I understand, that I will be despised, but I am in need of recommendations for some completely automatic coffee machine.

In my defense, it is not intended for my use, but rather as a gift for my mother. I am very happy, that I was able to make her not Iike instant coffe anymore. And she even prefers speciality beans to supermarket ones. But she finds even an Aeropress too much work, not to mention the manual grinding. So she almost never makes a cup herself.

So I am looking for a bean-to-cup machine, that she could feed a bag speciality coffe beans and then just make cups with button presses. It might not be necessarily an espresso machine.

However, these machines are usually known for their subpar performance, when it comes to quality in the cup.

So are there any good ones? It needs to be able to grind the coffee itself. Also some setting for different roast levels would be nice. Milk-frothing ability is not required, albeit not superfluous either.

Coffee,"Hi there!

I  help to run a very small (only open for 2/3 months of year) coffee  shop.  In the past we had always used a simple drip coffee machine,  which while adequate in the past, is very basic and actually has stopped  working properly (leaks etc).  With that in mind, we've been  considering upgrading our coffee setup to something a little bit more  substantial.  Ideally, we would love to be able to serve espresso, but a  commercial espresso/barista machine is completely off the table for us.   They cost upwards of 2000 euros, even second hand, and considering  that's close to our annual profit, this is clearly not an option.   Renting a machine also isn't an option, as most contracts are for 12  months minimum.

I unfortunately am  not that well informed about the world of espresso - I have some  (limited) experience working in the past in a cafe which had a standard  commercial machine, and I've watched a smattering of YouTube videos on  the topic, but beyond that I know very little.  I have been researching  various consumer appliances in the 200-500 euro range, and my worry is  that the durability may not be up to scratch.  I would expect that we  would be making somewhere between 20-50 cups of coffee per day, 4-5 days  a week.  A two group machine would also be highly preferable, as it  wouldn't be uncommon to get orders for 5-6 cups of coffee simultaneously  if there is a large group of people.  I have also spotted a  Pontevecchio Lusso 2 group manual espresso machine for sale secondhand,  which seems like an intriguing option.

Coffee,"I’ve been researching for months and every time I’m ready to make the purchase I look around one more time and end up finding a reason to rethink which one to buy.


I’m budgeted to afford the Niche and I like the Fellow, but overall I’m leaning towards the Eureka. I won’t be making espresso or Turkish style so super fine isn’t as important for me. I like making pour-overs, using my aeropress, and occasional french press. 


I like that the Eureka has flat burrs, is stepless, has single dose bean chute adapters with the bellow available on Etsy, and built to be cleaned a little easier due to the burr placement. People mentioned having to hold the on button for it to function, but I’ve seen flipper switches for sale that I could replace it with as a workaround. Idk I feel like I missing something better about the other grinders.


What would you go with if you were picking one of these three?

Update: I decided on the Eureka Filtro and it should be coming in about a week. I’ll keep you all posted on how it goes. For context I’m currently using a Baratza Encore with the M2 burr upgrade. I’m driving myself crazy endlessly reading, why would you buy a Eureka Mignon Filtro over a Fellow Ode or Niche Zero?",research months every time ready make purchase look around one time end finding reason rethink one buy budget afford niche like fellow overall leaning towards eureka making espresso turkish style super fine important like making pour overs using aeropress occasional french press like eureka flat burrs stepless single dose bean chute adapters bellow available etsy build clean little easier due burr placement people mention hold button function see flipper switches sale could replace workaround idk feel like miss something better grinders would picking one three update decide eureka filtro coming week keep post goes context currently using baratza encore burr upgrade driving crazy endlessly reading would buy eureka mignon filtro fellow ode niche zero

Coffee,"Hi there, I would like to get your opinions on choosing the beans for cold brew. I heard cold brew is less demanding on the quality of the beans. Does it mean I can actually use the ones from the supermarket shelves (like Tylor or Illy) and still make a good cup? 

I usually buy beans from local cafe or coffee shops online. Mostly signal origin or at least a very well blend. I absolutely detest starbucks beans bc they all taste burnt and overpriced. But if I can make a decent cold brew with supermaket coffee beans, I don't mind to give it a try and save some extra bucks. Just that those supermarket package are usually quite big.

Coffee,"Hello. I'm looking for a home espresso machine that I intend to keep for 1-2 years before I move on to something in the likes of ECM Synchronica. I need something budget oriented to learn and not be afraid of it breaking as I have kids that might be interested in all tubes and knobs of expensive espresso machine and I don't want to risk breaking it before they grow up a little bit.

If it comes to my requirements I'm making two milk based drinks at a time (rarely 3) with usually 4 drinks a day (6 on the weekends). I'm replacing moka pot with standalone crappy milk steamer. If it comes to the grinder I have Niche Zero.

Now the big question is which machine should I get? Gaggia Classic goes for around 380 USD (I'm in EU) while Rancilio Silivia costs around 650 USD which sounds excessive as from what I gather from the comments it's not that much better. Should I get Gaggia Classic and just forget about it, or is there anything else that would be better around 500 USD mark?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit:

It just came to my attention that there are some inferior models of Gaggia Classic out there. Is Gaggia New Classic legit with aluminum boiler? Here's a link of what I'm after:

Coffee,"I finished 2020 getting a moka pot and stepping down from pods. Now I've got a Chemex I fell in love with and I buy wholebeans which I grind with a Timemore C2. I love the coffee I'm brewing and its experience, YET I have this damn feeling of wanting to upgrade.

Right now what I want to upgrade to is a Comandante C40, cause I've read and was told so much good stuff about it that I just *want* it but... Do I even need it!? I've been with this brainworm for a couple months already. I managed to shake it off a bit but as my birthday is getting closer, I can't help but think this would be a good gift to myself... But I'm back to the question of ""Do I even need it?"" as I'm unsure if it will actually step up my coffee experience when compared to the Timemore C2 in any kind of noticeable way.

I'm trying to cope with this. I've manage(d) to cope with this when it comes to headphones as I bought different headphones for different purposes rather than focusing on upgrades, but in here with coffee I only see upgrades to my current setup as *sidegrades* would either be cheap (Buying a V60 - so if I feel like playing with it, I will just buy it) or I don't have where to fit them now (Buying an espresso machine). Even when upgrading headphones, I could notice a reliably better experience with the new gear, but I feel as if with coffee that would be different as the amount of variables is far greater (type of beans, water, grind size, brew type, brew recipe...).

Coffee,"Yesterday I cleaned my grinder so I thought ""why not give the kettle a wash as well?"". So I did that, using a sponge (I use only for glasses &amp; mugs) and some dish soap. I rinsed it well and left it to dry overnight. 

This morning I made some coffee and it had some distinguished metallic taste note and a minor hint of chocolate... which means I done eff'd up.

I remember this used to happen with the thermos mug (also stainless steel... maybe not that stainless tho) as well, if I washed it and left it to dry, so I would usually just fill it up with water, wash it just before use the next day.

Coffee,"I've been following the common advise to ""grind as fine as you can until you get the sudden wall of bitterness. Then go one step courser again and that should be the sweet spot for that coffee.""

But a roaster recently gave me these instructions for dialing in a coffee: ""You can adjust either the grind size or your brew time to your flavour preferences; a coarser grind or shorter brew time for more acidity and fruity flavours, a finer grind or longer brew time for more sweetness and bitterness.""
EDIT- roaster was specifically referring to an Aeropress brew, where grind size and brew time can be adjusted independently. 

For pourover, does this imply not to always dial down for that sweeter cup, because getting a ""sweet"" cup could be at the expense of getting nice fruity acidity? Do you guys agree with this; if so, what's your general practice when dialing in for grind size? I'm thinking you go by the particular coffee and what you like to taste; but I'm interested in what you have to share about this topic.

Coffee,"I purchased the Oxo Pour Over with Water Tank a couple months back and was excited for the combination of quality and convenience. The vast majority of reviews were favorable, and even taken with a grain of salt pointed towards a decently complex cup of coffee.

Unfortunately, despite daily use for the past 2 months I've been unable to find the right ""recipe."" Typically I use medium dark to dark roast beans, purchased from a local roaster in Seattle...as fresh as could be. Using a Heihox stainless burr hand grinder, I use about 17g of beans (I've also tried a bit more on occasion) for 10 oz of water. I've done everything from the Oxo-recommended medium grind down to nearly a fine grind. I've bloomed the grinds and not bloomed the grinds before using the water tank. 

No matter what, I feel like the water goes through the filter way too fast and doesn't extract enough complexity from the beans. I've used an Aeropress for years, and before that a Clever, but never experienced these issues.

Coffee,"Hi guys, so I’m a former barista who is searching for the perfect at home cup of black coffee. I didn’t brew many small batches at work so I having just feeling it out at home. 

 I am using a French press and would typically just eye ball my ratios but found my cups were super inconsistent and so I’m taking the advice of everyone here and actually taking the time to nail it by watching my ratio. 

I pulled out a kitchen scale we’ve had lying about and was aiming for a 1:12 ratio but when I started to see how much coffee it was I changed my mind and went 1:20 which was still a ton, several tablespoons by my estimate. 

I brewed it and it is better than what I’ve gotten before but very thick and strong. Black black. 

So I feel something was off, be it my kitchen scale, my calculations, or my method, or my understanding of what a strong cup of coffee is. Can anyone help me figure out where I went wrong? 

Details: 

600 g of purified water, 30 g of coffee (medium roast measured after I ground) 

I ground with my Bodum Bistro Burr grinder one click finer than it’s recommended grind for French press (had seemed very coarse previously) 

I let the coffee bloom in the hot 90 degree Celsius water for 2 minutes then poured the remaining and let sit for 3 minutes then pressed and poured. 

So, does this seem accurate? Again, the coffee was strong for me and I love black strong coffee so maybe everyone here likes stronger than I do? Or I did something wrong?

Update: not that anyone asked for it but I took some of your advice, 

I upped the heat to 95 degrees Celsius 

I double checked the scale, seemed to be accurate, and I did a 1:25 ratio today 

I cleared anything stuck in the grinder that might getting through into the grind

I also let it sit a few minutes longer before pouring so that the sediment and oils could settle. 

This cup was great and definitely more in line with what I like in a French press!

Coffee," I could use some advice from the crowd of coffee fanatics in here. My husband and I exclusively drink espresso at home, but because I have a small, not particularly flash machine (Breville Infuser) it's not so great for making coffee for guests when we have more than 4 people around. What do you find is a good method for making a large quantity of coffee quickly for a group of people? I've had coffee plungers in the past, which was fine, but open to other suggestions. We also grind our own beans, and have a Breville Smart Grinder Pro. I'm not particularly hard-core with my coffee, I enjoy a good cup but don't bother with weighing/measuring stuff or getting right down into the tiny details of everything. Thank you!

Coffee,"My wife and me drink coffee exactly like this:

Starbucks Espresso roast whole beans grocery store-bought vacuum-packed.
I grind these into a medium'ish grind in our burr grinder about once per week and place the ground coffee into a glass jar with lid and plastic scoop.
Each morning... water into teapot, 8 scoops of the ground coffee into a French Press, nearly boiling water into the Press, lid on, 9-12 minutes later, depress the plunger and pour into two 22oz travel insulated cups... each receiving appx a rounded tbsp to a tbsp &amp; a half of raw turbinado sugar.
The finished product is sipped throughout the day.
Absolutely pedestrian and plain-jane but it works for us.

Questions:

1. How can I improve this without ramping up my morning routine into a rabbit hole vortex of coffee science? We own a couple Francis/Francis espresso machines but stopped using them because we didn't want to spend time throughout the day having to make shots ~ we came to grips with our reality and that is, we just like making a large coffee each day and calling it Good.
Are their better methods to achieving that end in terms of ditching the Press for another method or device?

2. We hate that we use (and admit ↑ to using) Starbucks beans but after years of experimenting we finally admitted to ourselves that we actually like them ~ we really like a dark &amp; carmel'y flavor... that said we did a fair amount of due diligence in the decades we resided in both NYC and PDX only to admit, similar to craft beer that always ending up not tasting like beer at all but floral arrangements (again, just our opinion), that independent roasters beans typically have a molasses note that is very off-putting to our taste (I think we spent at least $500 on Stumptown visits when we lived in Portland always thinking the next Americano or espresso would be The One that got us hooked but alas it was not to be).

Coffee,"Hey all I'm having a hard time reconciling the potential for over extraction and brew time.  Specifically, brew methods that steep for long periods, like Hoffmann's Ultimate French Press technique (brew time 9-10 minutes) and cupping coffees for comparison (brew time 4-5 minutes, with more resting time after the crust is broken).

How does this not result in over-extraction, especially the french press technique?  I initially thought it might be because of the coarser french press grind, but Hoffmann's technique uses a medium grind.   Variables for extraction would be time, temperature, grind size, and agitation?  

What am I missing here?  Thanks!

Coffee,"I haven't seen much talk about this type of coffee, but it's a whole different experience that I wanted to share with you all!

I've lived in Malaysia for a few years and always liked the taste of their white coffee, but I had never had the chance to get to drink it in an authentic, local coffee shop, or as they call it here kopitiam, and they usually ended up being commercial powder packs that you just add hot water to.

In the past year I've gotten a lot more into brewing my own coffee as a hobby (because of covid lol), and for the first time I found real, Ipoh white coffee beans in a local supermarket - boy was I excited!!!

Before I talk more, Ipoh white coffee isn't the same white coffee you find in Yemen. Here, what white coffee is referring to is actually the roasting method used. An arabica and robusta blend is roasted in palm oil margarine! So cool right? Then, brewed coffee is mixed with a large amount of sweetened condensed milk, and served.

Now, I used a 8g to 100ml ratio (a little on the strong side I think, I like it tho lol) and a v60 pour over. I didn't have condensed milk so I added full fat fresh milk instead.

As soon as the coffee touched my tongue, I got such an intense burst of flavours in my mouth. Literally felt like being in heaven. It's such a unique flavour profile, it's extremely nutty, tastes like caramel, and has a certain smokey-ness/burnt taste to it (which is why sweetened condensed milk is added). The coffee isn't bitter at all, and it's just, beautiful.

I'm so glad I finally was able to find the real deal. If you like very powerful tastes in coffee, I absolutely recommend you try finding these beans. If you're into roasting, I absolutely recommend it as well.

Tldr: found ipoh white coffee beans, brewed it. My mouth had an orgasm.

Edit: It's a mix of arabic AND robusta beans :) also, it's ""white"" name is referring to the roasting, not the colour of the drink as I mistakenly first mentioned, my bad. Dear Malaysians, please fact check me :)

I take into account the weight of the other liquid I add to my coffee (Moka pot) which is just milk.

Coffee,"I’ve been grinding my own coffee with a Lido 3 for 5 years now. My coffee has always been “good” but I could never figure out how to properly dial it in. On a whim I purchased a bag of preground coffee from IKEA, which was vacuum sealed and actually not that bad. I always use my mocamaster with the same routine so I can at least control that variable.

Long story short, over the last couple years I had slowly shifted my grind size much larger and using much coffee to boot. Instead of 10 clicks from 0, I am now using about 6. My first attempt on my blue bottle Ethiopian was the best pot yet.

TL;DR

If you are having a hard time dialing in many types of coffee, buy some pre-ground (particularly from the place you but whole beans from) in order to recalibrate your understanding of grind size. YMMV of course.

Coffee,"Hi,

I've decided to make this post, coz I kinda feel bad about my coffee. Since I've started, I was making bad coffee, without any noticeable flavor, I've constantly lived in faith, that better equipment will solve my struggle. Now, I'd say I have decent equipment, which ""can"" extract nice flavors from coffee, I just realized that was always me. The thing is, I actually don't like my coffee - not in the way, I don't like coffee overall, it's just about those that I made myself. Since I've started, I've hardly ever enjoyed truly my cup of coffee. I had a break, today new coffee has arrived, but I still making shitty coffee. Can you help me a bit? How I may improve? Here's my equipment:

Grinder - comandante c40

V60 - just some plastic Hario with Japanese filters

Gosse neck kettle with temperature control and scale obviously

Some Polish spring water

The way I doing my v60's (18 gram of coffee beans grinded in 20th click with 300 grams of water, \~98 celsius degrees):

0-0:30 preinfusion adding 35-40 grams of water

0:30 - \~1:00/1:10 adding another 140 grams of water, waiting a bit to make it pour-over, and gently swirl a couple of times to get coffee from the v60 sides.

1:10-3:00 adding 120 grams of water. It'll take me about 3:00/3:10 mins.

Result? Very bitterly, ""waterly"", without any nice flavor. It's just not a pleasant thing to drink, which makes me kinda bad.

Coffee,"Okay so I found this video (https://youtu.be/HkGAtFirGhs) on how to make espresso-esque iced coffee with a moka pot. Please watch the first three minutes.

It’s so fucking damn confusing . First she says that you need 5 ounces of cold water for every 4 ounces (so 30 grams for each espresso right) in a moka pot for iced coffee. 

Then she randomly makes some bizarre switch/measurement switch and says you have to use 15 ml of espresso (doesnt she mean grams?) to 3 ounces of water. What the fuck? 

How does she go from 4 ounces of espresso (can someone confirm she means ground coffee) / 5 ounces of water as the first measurement to the second measurement which is .5 ounce of espresso to 3 ounces of water in the moka pot? 

4 ounces of espresso (she keeps switching between ml and gram, which one is it ) is 120 grams and then 5 ounces of cold water is 150 grams. And her 2nd measurement, half an ounce of espresso to 3 ounce of water is 15 grams espresso to 90 grams of water 

How does she go from 120/150 to 15/90, can someone explain her confusing af measurement adjustments?

Bottom line can you explain her logic and clearly tell me how much coffee in grams and water in grams i need in the moka pot

Coffee,"For a while now, I've been buying my coffee beans at a local coffee shop that had weekly fresh roasted coffee beans. Every time I walked out feeling like I just bought premium coffee that should blow away everything I could get in a store. Yet despite the large bloom and supposed freshness, it always tasted mediocre or flat out bad, regardless of which kind I bought there. I figured I must be doing something wrong, because coffee that fresh (and expensive) shouldn't taste bad.

Then I visited some local farm markets for the first time. Looking at their coffee, I saw that the roasting date was about a month old. I thought ""A month? That's not fresh compared to the coffee shop"", but figured I'd try some anyway. Long story short, it was great, far better than the coffee I was buying at the coffee shop.

So don't make the mistake I made. If coffee is bad, don't keep buying it because it ""should"" be good. As I've learned from this Reddit, fresh roast does not mean fresh raw coffee.

Edit: To clarify, I believe the coffee shop was using old beans which were only freshly roasted. Aka old coffee with new roast vs possibly fresher coffee with older roast.

Coffee,"Hi there!

I hope you can help - I'm getting confused and frustrated!

Brewing with a V60 (bagged papers) and a Niche Zero (with disk) using James Hofmann's method. The issue has become targeting brew times, since they seem to vary wildly. One coffee was hitting 3:40 ish regularly  on grind setting 38, tasting amazing and we were happy. A different coffee, same grind size, same method took over 5 minutes. What's going on? I'm probably going to be too coarse for the scale to grind coarse enough to get this one faster. A lot of the time, the super slow coffees taste good anyway, but I'd rather hit the time I want first before adjusting grind size to taste, so I can be sure I'm not missing out on flavours.

Ultimately, we decided against with the conclusion of... it probably doesn’t matter which coffee we brew because the flavor will get buried by the overpowering flavor of the CoffeMate creamer we buy from the grocery store.

So my question is... is there an ideal milk, or creamer, or whatever, that still allows for the subtle flavors of a particular blend?

Coffee,"After messing around with both the AeroPress and the Clever dripper here's what I have found.

The clever jumper is the easiest and takes the least amount of effort to get a pretty decent cup of coffee. The coffee you get will be better than most coffee as you get from a auto drip or even let's say a French press. It's got the body of a French press but it has the cleanliness of a pour over because of that paper filter.

After messing with multiple recipes with the Clever Dripper what I have found is that the coffee you get from the Dripper is decent. It's not great but it's decent. It is very consistent and reliable. It's almost next to impossible to get a bad cup of coffee. The coffee tastes bright, clean and smooth all around. However sometimes you get coffee that is weak. It's not bad but sometimes it's weak.

And that is where the AeroPress comes into play. The AeroPress takes a little more effort, but you almost never end up with a weak cup of coffee. At least I haven't yet.

After looking at a lot of videos I was almost afraid of the AeroPress because it looks like you need a lot of upper body strength to push it down but it's actually very easy. I can push the plunger down with one hand no problem.

The coffee you get from the AeroPress is stronger more full-bodied, richer and smoother. There are more recipes to play around with. This will make it easier to find the type of brew that you might actually love.

Where the AeroPress is more annoying though is that there are so many parts it takes up some space. The Clever Dripper is just one part. And you don't need a gooseneck kettle.

If you have a Clever Dripper by an air press and you might enjoy the coffee once in awhile. And if you have a AeroPress go ahead and buy the Clever Dripper and it could be your daily brew.

TLDR: The clever dripper is the easiest to get a good cup. But with the AeroPress you get a better cup with a little bit more effort. Aeropress VS.

Coffee,"**I like dark roasts with lots of cream and a little sugar.**

I know only a very little bit about coffee artisanship, and I'm getting into being a more sophisticated coffee drinker. There are so many different brewing methods: automatic drip, percolator, French press, pour over, siphon, etc.

I've had auto drip (the American casual standard) and percolator (much preferred over auto drip), and I'm sure other kinds from coffee shops but I don't know which ones.

I've read dark roasts need a slightly lower water temperature and a different grind level, but what's a good brewing method for them? I like my coffee super bold - lots of flavor in small sips - and then level it out with lots of cream and a little sugar.

Coffee,"I do this: I mix the syrup in the hot espresso, then I pour milk into the espresso to make it lukewarm. Then I pour the milk/espresso/syrup over a cup of ice. The end.

So she wants me to do it like this: pour hot espresso into the a measuring cup and stir in syrup. Pour and mix the milk. Pour the espresso/milk/syrup into the customer's cup.

Coffee,"So I'm basically getting more and more into coffee and was just wondering if I'm being a nitpicky pedantic idiot.

I'm trying different beans from local roasters and just got a bag that was roasted at the start of the month. My go to coffeeshop that I was buying from before, once told me that the coffee that wasn't already bagged is usually a few days old at max.

We're talking about a really dark and strong roast, and from what I've learned so far they go stale a little bit quicker because the longer a bean is being roasted the more brittle it gets and therefore the oxidation happens faster.

So am I being pedantic worrying about a month old coffee from a roaster that on their websites states ""our beans are fresh of the roast"" (it's on German so that's a rough translation)

I'm not even sure I would taste the difference tbh, but my take was that a roaster that sells specialty coffee and advertises fresh beans shouldn't sell ones that are a month old.

Happy to hear your take, and if it's just calling me an idiot. Like I said, I'm pretty new to all of this.

Edit: thank you all for the super informative answers.
I wrote to tell them that I received a month old bag when they advertised fresh beans. I'm sure the coffee is good and I don't even know if I have that much of a refined pallet yet, but like I said I had a go to place before where I got really nice beans that were just a few days old at max.
So I didn't expect a specialty roaster to ship me beans that were shelved for that long.

Coffee,"**TL;DR** \- looking for help in finding a coffee in London/UK that tastes the same/similar to a small Italian chain that had shops in London and other cities inc. a few internationally that I've never found a similar tasting coffee to since. Any help much appreciated

**Edit to add:** I'd totally forgot that earlier this year I actually found somewhere a mile from me that has *very* similar tasting coffee to Fratelli - can't see any info on what they use etc but for anyone interested is [https://mackbearcoffee.uk/](https://mackbearcoffee.uk/) Not quite the same but basically good enough in absence of the real thing - if you've any other recommendations or further thoughts on what makes them similar feel free to  cont. to advise!

**Long version:** Could you help me - I've never been good with being able to describe or articulate flavours etc (but when tasting I know what I like and what I don't like) and am no coffee connoisseur so can't be specific but I hope someone familiar with them who was will know and be able to help

There used to be this small chain with a few shops in London called Caffe Fratelli. They had shops in Potter's Fields behind City Hall SE1, Wigmore St W1 and a tiny one on Aldwych WC2 (the ones I had gone to at least), possibly more around the city and the UK but definitely a few in other cities around the world (their website is no more so can't confirm intl. locations unfortunately). If it might help jog anyone's memory you can see their brand on their (inactive) fb [here](https://www.facebook.com/LoveCaffeFratelli/) and twitter [here](https://twitter.com/caffefratelli?lang=en) (note: there's also [this place](https://www.facebook.com/delicaffefratelli/), I think still open, in the Dockland's which is unrelated to them)

I have been looking for something similar ever since they sadly shut down w/o notice a couple of years ago. Does anyone by chance remember these guys and were familiar enough with them to have any idea what the beans/flavours/particulars that achieved the taste of the coffees that these guys used to do? Do you have recommendations for anywhere in London that makes a similar tasting coffee? They used to sell beans in big blue bags, and I actually bought a bag at one point before I had any idea what I was buying (they sat in a couple of jars for a year or two..).

I tried to hunt down info through other means at the time to no avail, i.e contacting the chain that took over the Potter's Fields shop, which were also Italian and v similar in a lot of ways except the actual taste of their coffee, and shortly after the Fratelli closed I did also look them up on companies house to see if I could contact the owners for info re: source of beans or anything else that could help me find a similar tasting cup (but didn't follow through in actually reaching out I don't think, was couple of years ago so don't remember)

The flavour was so distinctive and have never found similar since but always wanted to. If I had to put a word on it I would say chocolaty, but as someone who's clueless re: taste I'm sure this is probably highly crude and possibly genuinely inaccurate/literally wrong to someone who actually has the knowledge of reading flavours and the vocabulary to be able to articulate it to match.

Coffee,"Broke your carafe but don't feel great about chucking a perfectly good coffeemaker in the garbage? Bonavita doesn't make replacements anymore, but there is a solution: [Chemex](https://www.chemexcoffeemaker.com/six-cup-glass-handle-series-coffeemaker.html).

**A few tips:**

* You must use [the six-cup version](https://www.amazon.com/Chemex-Glass-Handle-Pour-over-Coffeemaker/dp/B0036YFTO4/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&amp;keywords=chemex+six-cup&amp;qid=1622030266&amp;sr=8-3). Larger sizes won't fit; smaller sizes don't hold enough coffee.
* You must use [Chemex filters](https://www.amazon.com/Chemex-Natural-Coffee-Filters-Square/dp/B017OFOP68/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&amp;keywords=chemex+filters+100&amp;qid=1622030378&amp;sr=8-3). Because they're unsupported at the bottom, regular #4 filters will fall apart partway through the brewing process and dump all the grounds.
* You have to cut off the corners of the Chemex filters with scissors—they're too tall otherwise. You might not have to do this if you buy the more expensive [Chemex ""Circle"" filters](https://www.amazon.com/Chemex-Bonded-Coffee-Filter-Circle/dp/B0000CF2WP/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&amp;keywords=chemex+filters+100&amp;qid=1622030378&amp;sr=8-5), although I'm not sure whether these will fit unaltered.
* You have to push the top part of the Bonavita up slightly from its normal horizontal position in order for the Chemex to fit. The Bonavita is designed to do this for cleaning—no problem.

[Here's what it looks like](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gMP-KMXG8dmOQkedLi6AxdNc5rMkkUs_/view?usp=sharing).

Coffee,"I'll try to keep this short (probably won't happen though), but if others are somehow interested, I can add more information and pontificate more. This is just a post with some information that could be useful or maybe a conversation starter. I've just been so stoked about getting more consistent brews that I wanted to share. I'm admittingly a novice here...

A few years ago, I wanted to stop buying coffee by the cup and hoarding empty cups in my room. It was costly and inconsistent. I told myself that I would eventually roast, grind, and extract coffee myself. I started trying different instant coffee brands and quickly came away extremely dissatisfied. I then got an Aeropress, Knock Aerspeed grinder, kettle, coffee cannister, cleaning brushes, etc. I also ordered 20+lbs of various green coffee to try. With that, I got a cheap heat gun and a metal hole strainer. The rest of the stuff needed I had in my house already like a nicely-shaped stainless steel bowl for roasting, metal whisk, gloves, utility fan, etc. If you're doing the heat gun method for roasting, I found that bowls with a small bottom (where the beans aren't as spread out) works better. I also double up with another bowl I had for a larger thermal mass.

Coffee choice and Roasting:

I found that I just love the Indonesian coffees like those from Sumatra and Sulawesi. I also like Papua New Guinea coffee. I tried a Yemen coffee that was spectacular but very expensive. Anyway, I generally take the beans a few seconds into a rolling second crack. I also don't rush the 1st crack and like to build it slow to help make sure the roast is permeating through the bean and not just getting color on the surface. If the second crack doesn't have good momentum, I go longer into it until I feel it's time to pull it. I don't time or take temperature readings of the roast. I look, listen, and smell how the roast is coming along. Nothing fancy here and I'm clearly a novice but the roasts come out beautifully (evenness and smell) after only a year of practice. Maybe one day I'll look into an actual coffee roaster, but then I feel I might loose the tactile approach of having that degree of freedom to control the heat and stay close to the process.

When I roast, I now do batches of about 300-400g as it feels like a sweet spot with my setup. I roast about once a week and it takes maybe 25-30 minutes total with cleanup and storage. The utility fan I have tilts completely flat so I just plop the hot beans in the metal strainer on top and it cools them down to the touch extremely quickly.

Storage:

I use a single coffee cannister. It's one of those ceramic ones with a air plunger, which I stopped using because it's pretty much useless with this application. I just cap the coffee beans with the silicon lid and call it a day. There's enough of an air gap to let the CO2 do its thing. The coffee rotation is so frequent (once or more a week) that I never have old coffee to worry about anyway. I could also use a mason jar with a gasket, which actually keeps a seal and sounds satisfying when you open it under pressure, but again, I don't see the point when you're working with fresh coffee.

Grinding:

I target about 75g of a medium-fine grind (with the Knock Aerspeed grinder I'm at a 1:2, which is one full rotation and set on the number 2). I wanted a finer grind that would help even the extraction by having the grind size differential to be smaller. I've kept the grind size the same for months.

That brush I mentioned before? I use it to brush out the grinder. I also give it a few good puffs of air. A canned duster works well for this and lasts a while to just get a quick spray in from time to time.

French Press:

I haven't used the Aeropress in a while since I needed a way to make larger batches of coffee for my Mom and myself. I opted to try the French press. You can probably bury me with this thing. I even use it as a water pitcher after I'm done roasting and cleaning the pot. I got a 1.5L stainless steel variant, which is perfect for 3 large mugs.

Extraction Method:

I get a nice quick bloom with near-boiling water. I don't measure the water. I look at how the bloom is forming then circle it with a slow pour from the kettle in a circular motion. Fresher roasts bloom more I noticed. I don't stir at all. I let the coarser grinds naturally rise up so those extract more than the finer grinds which fall down. No idea if this is true or not, but I know there is a crust that forms of coarser grinds, which I think need more extraction anyway, so I stopped stirring altogether. Once the bloom has enough momentum to rise up, I refill my kettle with water that is around 180-190F and slowly fill up the French press in stages (just like you would with a pour over) as I want the coarser grinds to have a chance to rise up again. I fill up the French press until there is a little buffer space for the plunger, otherwise you get pieces of coffee grinds that don't get pressed down and will float in your cup.

Once all of the water is in, I put the plunger in and barely submerge to keep the remaining crust in the water. No idea if this does anything but I figured it would be better than leaving the coarser grinds less submerged.

At/around 3:30 to 4:00, I slowly plunge down to nearly the bottom and pour out the coffee into mugs in a rotation as the coffee seems to taste different from the top vs. the bottom in the French press. I've tried longer times and did the James Hoffmann thing of not plunging down but I thought about it and didn't see the point as a slow plunge shouldn't stir up things much. Instead, I think plunging helps get more of the fines out. I didn't notice much difference of waiting an additional 5 minutes either as far as taste, but I admit that I should try it more in the future and keep experimenting.

When I pour the remaining coffee, I try not to push down on the plunger, which would compress the grinds since they are no longer a flat bed due to the tilting motion of pouring. I stop pouring as the flow is pretty much done and comes out like a trickle. Basically, I keep the French press as level as it has to be and try to not disturb or tip it more than I need to. I dump the grinds and do a hand wash with soap on the pot and clean the plunger once in a while. Usually hot water is enough to remove most of the coffee oils. Since I use the thing everyday, nothing has time to get funky.

Conclusion:

I'm now at the point where I more consistently make cups of coffee that I can't stop drinking. I'm slowly building up a palate for tasting the differences between roasts but will openly admit that it's okay for coffee to just taste like good coffee even if you can't taste or smell the grapefruit notes or whatever it says on the package. Since I like my roasts on the medium-dark side, I don't expect to taste much fruitiness. To be honest, I've had single-origin light roasts from a local coffee shop before. That fruity coffee flavor is not pleasant at all for me but it might be something I nudge myself into. After all, the journey stops being fun when there's nothing left to discover.

In the morning, the coffee routine is about 30 minutes from start to finish. It's a chance to have a little conversation and be a little scientist to experiment with something new (if you want to that is). I make myself two mugs: one without cream (half and half) and one with a little cream as a treat. I do an initial taste for the strength and usually add a tiny bit of cold water if it's on the stronger side. If I'm adding cream, I don't add as much water.

That is where I'm at. I look forward to continuing the journey and maybe getting others to try my coffee at family gatherings once we're more in the clear with COVID. Well folks, I did it!

I'm not sure if i'm doing something wrong but I every time I do, I'm left with coffee grounds all over my counter. The grinder is used and I read that it's not meant to be cleaned.

Coffee,"With the recent popularity of the tricolate, I have been intrigued by this kind of no-bypass brewing. I have been doing a similar thing using v60 filters in a Stagg \[X\] for a while to eliminate bypass, but that's not a perfect solution. Being a little bit of a cheapskate, I wanted to see what I could do with what I had on hand. This post will be a little bit speculative because I'm still new to this, but I will post some updates after more experimentation. I was just excited to share. Here's what I came up with.

First of all, the aeropress filters aren't really acceptable for this application. They clog really easily, and cause too many problems for me to deal with. I have had success with splitting a v60 filter at the seam, cutting it along the fold, and just shoving the half of the filter into the aeropress cap and clicking it into place on the bottom chamber.

Secondly, there needs to be some kind of dispersion screen at the top of the chamber. I've tried it without, and never had success. Those brews always channeled and had pitted, slanted, and uneven beds at the end. I don't really understand why, but that seems to be how it is. I don't have a melodrip or a second aeropress cap, so I used my Stagg \[X\]. The 10 holes in the bottom seem to do well enough to make an even extraction possible. I had to pour as fast as I could with my Hario kettle to get a decent water column above the holes, which is important to ensure that water actually goes through all the holes. I seemed to have better success with adding a mesh screen above the holes of the dripper to slow the flow through the holes and get a more even dispersion, but I could be wrong about that.

The dose is important to consider as well. I have had success using 12g of coffee, which gives a bed depth of \~1.3cm. I kind of just guessed based on Scott Rao's recommendation of 18g in the tricolate, hoping that 12g produces a similar bed depth. Without knowing the diameter of the tricolate, I can't say for sure, but doses in the neighborhood of 12g seem to work well.

My coffee to water ratio has been 1:17, which is the same as my pour overs, but that is mainly because I'm still relatively new to this way of brewing, and I didn't want to deal with some of the risks associated with a 1:20 ratio like many people use with no-bypass brewers. The strength of my ""aerolate"" brews has felt like it's a good bit higher than my typical pour overs, but I can't say for sure because I don't have a refractometer. I will try that 1:20 ratio later this week and update this post with my thoughts.

I'm still getting my head around grind size, but I have had success at significantly finer grind sizes than my 22:375 pour overs. For reference, on my Kinu m47 phoenix, espresso falls around 1.0.0, Hoffmann method aeropress around 1.8.0, and the aforementioned pour overs around 3.8.0. I've been messing around in the 2.5.0 to 3.0.0 range with this method, but I'm optimistic about even finer grind sizes because I've been being relatively cautious with the grind size to avoid really bad results while I'm still learning. My brew times have been between 4:30 and 5:30, which also gives me hope for finer grind sizes because I've heard about people getting good results with \~7 minute brew times. I'll update this post later this week after I give that try.

For my pouring technique, I've been doing pretty much exactly what Scott Rao does in his tricolate video, which is a 1 minute long 3:1 swirled bloom, followed by one big pour up to the total weight, followed by another swirl. It's really important to start off with a perfectly flat bed of coffee. It also helps to remove the stagg while swirling to avoid it falling off. Rao has also mentioned that breaking up the post-bloom water into more pours can help get things more even because a shorter water column can help swirls be more effective. I'm not sure I understand why, but I'll try it and update later this week.

To sum up, I think that using an aeropress to mimic a tricolate can be a good way to explore no-bypass brewing without sinking too much money into a new brewer. I've found the results to be very enjoyable, and contrary to what some say, every bit as complex as my other brews. Things have been a little more acidic than usual with my current grind sizes, but I think that will be remedied with an even finer grind size. I'm hopeful that this will yield some stunning results after a little more practice and experimentation.

tldr: click half a v60 filter into an aeropress base. Put a Stagg \[X\] or other dispersion screen on top and pour some water through the whole thing to preheat. Add 12g of coffee and shake the brewer to get it level, then put the Stagg back on the chamber. Pour about 36g of water into the brewer, and give it a thorough swirl. After 1 minute, pour up to 204g of water as fast as possible. After the water has drained into the aeropress base, give it another good swirl.

UPDATE: regarding dose, I just found a number for the diameter of the tricolate. It's apparently 80mm, adn the aeropress seems to be 58mm across. I did the math and found that 18g in the tricolate is the same depth as \~9.5g in an aeropress and 20g in the tricolate is the same depth as \~10.5g in the aeropress. I found those numbers by assuming the density of ground coffee is 1g/ml, rearranging the formula for volume of a cylinder to find height, then plugged in the appropriate numbers for radius and volume of each brewer in separate expressions, then set those equal to each other and solved for the volume of the smaller one. 18/((40\^2)\*pi)=X/((29\^2)\*pi) and solve for X to get 9.46. The assumption for the density of ground coffee means that I don't actually know what the bed depth is, but I'm reasonably confident that I'm right about this. Please feel free to correct me on this if I'm wrong.

Coffee,"For a start, I just started to love coffee. I don't have fancy equipments, and I have an unbranded manual grinder I got from a local online shop. 

Months and months I've been on pour overs and seems like I never get it right. It's either over brewed and too bitter or too acidic, and it just isn't enjoyable for me.

I realized that my manual grinder is not consistent with grind size. I have to constantly readjust the screw at the bottom of the grinder and since money is tight I have to make do with what I have. 

Until one day I came across [this video from Warkop Asiang](https://youtu.be/eXd1vLDu6Vk) and I closely observed how he makes his coffee. Asiang is a local legend. With nothing to lose, I thought I'll give it a try.

I don't know what the brewing method is called, but basically he puts coffee grounds in a pitcher, pour hot water, stir, brew for about 2 minutes then pour into a sieve.

I did my best to grind my beans to somewhere in between what I do to pour overs and French press.

Holy moly. What a change! 

This brewing style is more forgiving for my shitty inconsistent grinder. I love it to bits.

Even our supposedly strong and bitter Barako coffee came as a surprise. I've tried two types of local coffees using this method and I'm surprised at how I noticed their flavors have finally made an appearance on my palate.

I think I'll be using this method for now on. Perhaps I'll go back to pour over later. I admit defeat to say that I suck at pour overs.

Coffee,"Hello everyone

So just bought my timemore C2 a month ago and I'm very happy with it. It makes such a difference between the C2 (and other hand grinders) and a cheap electric one (without blurs)

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is that I remember first time using it and it was quite hard, I had to put some strength on it and took me like 2 minutes. Now it's super easy to grind with almost no strength at all and I grind it in less than a minute.

Coffee,"My Mignon XL is just 2 days old and I noticed that the burrs rub only at one point in the rotation, indicating that both may be misaligned. I then opened it up and did the marker test and alas I was right. The rotating burr is off (check image below) and since there's only one section of contact then the fixed burr is also definitely off. I've heard that it's quite common for the static burr to be a bit misaligned but much rarer for the rotating burr. Is this true and is this acceptable for a brand new piece? Should I just spend a few hours shimming and sorting it out or should I be sending it back to get replaced?

Coffee,So I’m very new to the coffee game but happen to be a college kid who frequents local coffee shops for study groups. One of the biggest no no’s it seems in the coffee community is buying pre ground super market coffee - I have several that I have tried and obviously a professional barista is going to make a better cup than I can at home - but it’s still good and flavorful and most importantly easy to manage time and money wise. I recognize the difference but I’m wondering why this is such a negative thing and if it is why don’t more companies sell their beans whole if the majority of people prefer to grind at home?

 What is the difference between a black or matt black kettle finish compared to silver shiny finish? I'm talking about heat loss and retention here. (Edited)

That being said I just started exploring pourover coffee from always making coldbrew. Cause coldbrew is more convenient and fuss free but the world of coffee is more than that. Started with a kalita style filter cup from Daiso and planning to get a v60 next.

I've decided to get the Hario fit kettle and I'm able to get the black version for cheaper which is usually more expensive. Hope the community could enlighten me on this.

Coffee,"This is a long post but the ending is worth it.

Background: I live with my parents and younger sister, and my mother was the only hardcore coffee drinker up until 3 weeks ago (my sister liked a Starbucks Frappuccino here and there). Also I never understood how coffee drinkers couldn’t “start their day without a cup of coffee” and i always thought that was silly. My mom being one of those people (she has never skipped a cup in 3 years).

so,

about a month ago, My mom told my sister and I that she was going to buy an espresso maker and encouraged us to try it out so we wouldn’t drink Redbull as energy fuel. I warned her i seriously doubt id use it since i’ve never liked the taste of coffee, but once it arrived 3 weeks ago, she made me a cup of cappuccino. as i figured, i didn’t like it and couldn’t get over that bitter coffee taste. i added a lot of milk and a TON of sugar to cover the taste so that it was tolerable. 
Fast forward a few days later, my sister got that Delight Vanilla cream and is now drinking a cup a day. I also attempted a cappuccino on my own here and there adjusting the milk and sugar ratio as well as the Delight cream. The taste started to grow on me and soon i started added less sugar. I still needed the delight vanilla flavor but the bitter coffee taste added a nice contrast. (i still do need that delight cream)

Here’s the funny part:

I started working in the mornings again and one morning a week ago, i didn’t make a cup since i wanted an extra 30 minutes of sleep. Although i never enjoyed working in the morning, that morning from 8-10ish i was especially tired and irritable and i couldn’t understand why. 

By noon it hit me: *I didn’t make a cup of coffee this morning*

I told my mom when i got home and she basically said “there’s no shame in having coffee to function like a normal person, honey.”

Fun fact; i’m having my cup of the day as typing this, and i’m not ashamed.

Coffee,"Hi all! So I've been using coffee sock's cloth filter for the Chemex for a while and I've been really enjoying the slightly  ""muddier"" coffee from the cloth compared to the paper filters. But for the last couple of weeks it has started to take a very long time to brew with the filter because the flow rate or drawdown is so slow, presumably from the warm water shrinking the filter. For some context I store it submerged and boil it every once in a while to keep it free from bacteria and mildew. 

My thought on fixing it would be to go to town with a small needle and prick some holes to increase the flow again, but I wanted to ask here if anyone has a better solution if you've had the same problem. Didn't really find anything relevant when I searched Google. Thanks! Cloth filter drawdown is getting very slow.

Coffee,"Hi everyone. I am new to the game and I am wondering what you think of the below inconsistencies I am getting with the Sage Oracle Touch. I am happy to experiment but sometimes I want to grab a quick coffee and at the moment I am dialling in more or less in between shots - not to mention the amount of coffee I am wasting.

The OT automates the dose and tamping, so that should be the same each shot. When I do weigh the dose it appears consistent (22g).

&amp;#x200B;

My routine is:

Come in the kitchen, turn the machine on. Sit down for 20 minutes and have breakfast whilst it warms up with the portafilter attached.

&amp;#x200B;

The following results are from yesterday evening, and then this morning. The beans used were roasted on March the 18th (bean brothers - UK). All of the following shots were pulled using beans from the same bag within 18 hours.

&amp;#x200B;

On the OT, the lower the grind number, the finer the grind, and the higher = courser. The scale goes from 0 to 45.

In between these doses I have completely purged the machine of grind, so there is no mixture of grind sizes.

I have recently bought an aeropress and a hand grinder to go with it. Bought a locally roasted coffee sample set and started checking out different aeropress recipes (as you would). As an engineer I like to tweak stuff to make it just right for given situation but I'm new to the coffee world and its science. I was wondering how does coffee ratio relate to brewing time, if at all? Do I have to increase brewing time if I increase the amount of coffee that goes in?

Coffee,"Having some interesting experiences here with temperature for frothing oat milk: I'm using a manual milk frother and I get so much better results when starting frothing the milk at around 85 degrees Celsius. I turn off the Keramik stove but actually froth the milk on the stove, so it keeps warming up a little bit. It frothes faster, the result is even a little bit better than frothing at max. 60c, AND the milk is hotter, which means a hotter beverage - which I personally prefer. But I read everywhere, even at the milk package, that you can't go further than 60c. Any thoughts about it? Has anyone here had the same experience?

Coffee,"Hello coffee lovers! I got a brand new grinder and will likely get an espresso machine soon. Slowly going down the rabbit hole... But, until then, I have my Moka pot... So today I tried to do my first grind, using an old pre-grind coffee as benchmark and my eye as a precision measurement. I could swear the grain size was in the ball park of the pre-grind, but my beautiful Moka made tea instead, it must have been confused, so much watery substance sprouted it's amazing. 

I have two suspects: 

1) I grinded too coarse and I got water through. On that one, do you know in what ball park should Mignon specialita be if you want to use it to make coffee with the moka pot?

2) I did not stamp the coffee (never do for moka and always worked miraculously well) but maybe I made a mistake not tapping on the sides to make it evenly distributed. It looked super good from the top but the mignon did hit one side of the pot so maybe I created a path of least resistance that is not visible from the top. -- I did see a small fissure on one side but all the coffee was damp... 

In any case It is already my first try and so much things surface it is really amazing! if you have any suggestions I will be blissful to hear them!

Coffee,"Having watch Mr Hoffman's video on regrinding coffee https://youtu.be/6IjFfl-8Gu8 I was left with the small urge to try it for a while but didn't go through with it until a few days ago when I forgot to change from my cold brew grind setting of6 full turns on my JX pro to my V60 one at 3.5. After making a bit of a mess trying to get the grinds back in I eventually succeeded and got to grinding, and when I opened the catch bin at the bottom of the grinder what met me was a surprise. The grounds looked insanely fluffy and even and had deeply floral smell!

The actually brewing was around 25 seconds faster than normal and the taste was unreal; the clarity and balance increased significantly and a tropical storm hit my tongue with acidity, sweetness, and great vibes. The coffee was an Ethiopian Ayla competition lot from nomad roasters in Barcelona and although I'd been having decent results with it, I was struggling to bring out the pineapple and cherry notes that I could taste ever so subtly in the background. With the regrinding these became front and centre and brought out a bunch of other even more complex and subtle flavours that I struggle to describe.

Extraction wise as expected it was relatively similar with both brews sitting at a respectable 21.5% and with the reground at 21.3%, but taste wise the reground was by far better. After a bit more experimenting I was able to get a finer grind with 3.10 and up my extraction to 22.2% before starting to get issues with bypass. With a Burundi coffee also from nomad I got similar improvements and whilst this probably isn't enough for me to say regrinding is definitely better, it's probably worth trying out Not telling you to try regrinding, but also do it",watch hoffman video regrinding left small urge try days ago forget change cold brew grind setting full turns pro one making bit mess try get grinds back eventually succeed get grinding open catch bin bottom grinder meet surprise grounds look insanely fluffy even deeply floral smell actually brewing around seconds faster normal taste unreal clarity balance increase significantly tropical storm hit tongue acidity sweetness great vibes ethiopian ayla competition lot nomad roasters barcelona although decent results struggle bring pineapple cherry notes could taste ever subtly background regrinding become front centre bring bunch even complex subtle flavours struggle describe extraction wise expect relatively similar brews sitting respectable reground taste wise reground far better bit experiment able get finer grind extraction starting get issues bypass burundi also nomad get similar improvements whilst probably enough say regrinding definitely better probably worth try telling try regrinding also
Coffee,"I'm gonna take a guess that this is a good sub to put this on.

Coffee,"Hi. 

 I love to support my new neighborhood coffeeshops, but I find that the coffee at several of these places has an unpleasant aftertaste.  It's a lingering, slightly sour note at the back of the tongue with a vague similarity to honey.  I was surprised to experience it this week at a coffeeshop that is trying hard to brew good, hand poured-over coffee - with carefully controlled water temperature, water/coffee ratios, and brew times.  I don't get this when I brew at home, and I don't get it when I get coffee at really good places on the U.S. west coast.  I pretty consistently try to order only darker roasts.

Any ideas what the key variable is?  Type of bean?  Roasting time?

Coffee,"Left my job as a barista for two years in college to start a new position working in a pharmaceutical laboratory as a chemist, nice coworkers, good pay, interesting work, but terrible (and I mean TERRIBLE, some of the worst I've ever had) coffee in the cafeteria with no coffee shops nearby either. I've had it a few times in a pinch and legitimately couldn't finish it

Which brings me to the question of a coffee solution; at present I've been using an aeropress using my usual recipe, I pregrind coffee in the morning usually and keep it sealed for work (not ideal but really can't grind fresh there) but it's a little finicky in our very small canteen. Furthermore, we have to clock out and are timed for lunch, so my constraints are time, space and a fear of looking dumb! 

Has anyone any novel ideas or recommendations?

I've looked at a Hario v60 one cup (I use a chemex at home) but it's a similar amount of effort to my aeropress I feel.

I've even considered making cold brew and heating it up there lol

Has anyone ever used a nanopresso or minipresso? I've thought of it as a possibility

Coffee,"I’ve been doing happy mug for years for my coffee. It’s decent coffee. Better than a random bag at my grocery store. We don’t have good roasters here so it’s done me good. 

I read about Malabar Gold and did some research and saw they have a brew coffee too, but just espresso. That’s called Monsoon Medley. Decided to do 2#. It’s $15 /lb which is really reasonable and probably on the cheaper end of specialty coffee. Especially since it’s by the pound and not the smaller bags that are becoming standard these days. 

Wow… there is like 0 acid in this cup. It’s insanely smooth. I’m a fan. I’ll definitely be using this coffee a bit more. 

PS: I’m not really a coffee connoisseur, and just want a good cup at a decent price. To me I’m willing to go up to $18 per bag normally before I see diminishing returns.  

If you’re on the fence and like a smoother, very low acid coffee it’s worth a try.

Coffee,"For a while I've actually wanted to start a subscription with Trade to explore new and exciting coffees that I wouldn't have learned about before.

However, I've recently moved to South Korea on military orders, and Trade only ships within the US.

Are there other services that would be able to make similar recommendations and ship to APO addresses? Or even just a recommendation site where I could then purchase directly from the roasters?

I have a feeling that someone might want to talk about freshness and how the long shipments across the Pacific could impact that. That's not something I'm too worried about. If it ships a day or two after roasting, it would take a week or two to get here and that sounds like the perfect amount of degas time so that I could start brewing right away.

Coffee," Hey coffee people

After researching this sub for some months looking to upgrade my equipment for a more delicious cup I finally bought an Aeropress and a Timemore C2 hand grinder. And holy smokes - the taste! The difference!  

For the past months I was drinking moka pot coffee with generic pre-ground supermarket beans. The result was okay when I was patient enough to go for a low temperature and remove the pot from the heat in time. But more often than not it tasted bitter or burned and I always had to add water to make it less strong. So I decided to try something different and preferably foolproof. 

Since I'm a student living in a flat share with limited kitchen counter space, the method should be cost efficient and easy to store. Also it should be quick to clean and for the sake of my clumsyness not easy to break. So Pour over and French press were out of the equation. 

Entry Aeropress and freshly ground local beans. I'm still experimenting with different ground settings on the Timemore, ways to brew and coffee beans - so if anyone has advice for improvement it's more than welcome! 
So far, I went for James Hoffmanns ultimate Aeropress technique and googled recommended grind settings (~12 to 15 clicks) and the results were slightly different - but always good and tasty. It's just been a week but I'm looking forward to prepare coffee every morning now. The process and the little routine is so enjoyable in itself. My flatmate stopped using the moka pot as well! 

More often than not I don't understand half the technicalities that are discussed in this community tbh. But there's tons of good advice for rookies as well that shows you don't need a huge budget for a  good cup of coffee. So thank you r/coffee for making me get that Aeropress!

Coffee,"I recently ordered from five different roasters, and only one of them was of the usual light roast I became accustomed to a few years back. The one who ended up being the lightest roast isn’t all that popular or well-known even in its own area I’m guessing, and it seems a bit more removed from the latest trends in third wave coffee overall.

I know good roasters will roast to the bean rather than just follow an arbitrary 3-level classification system, but it’s just something I’ve been noticing a lot more this past year beyond these five new roasts I picked up.

Coffee,"hello everybody! new to this sub. hopefully somebody more knowledgeable than me can help steer me in the right direction. 

i’m currently brewing my v60 with 30g coffee to 500g of water. i add a pinch of kosher salt to the grounds before pouring. i do a 30- 45 second bloom, during which i swirl the grounds to evenly saturate. the rest of the brew goes like normal. i pour in slow concentric circles until i reach my target weight. when the level goes down a bit, i swirl again to help even the bed and knock any grounds off the sides. draw down is right at three minutes. coffee bed is flat at the end of the brew with no grounds stuck to the sides, so i’m guessing i have a relatively even extraction at the very least. (emphasis on the guessing)

my problem is weak tasting coffee. i was previously grinding coarser, which was resulting in even weaker tasting brews. so i’ve been steadily going finer with the grind which has in turn increased the draw down. 

so my question is: will an increase in draw down affect my brew negatively if i keep grinding progressively finer to reach the taste i’m looking for? and are there other ways to mitigate a weak tasting brew other than grinding finer?

Coffee,"Hello,

I am having trouble making coffee using a pour over coffee. As a background, I use a Coffee Gator Metal Filter. I use to use pre-ground coffee and it wasn't bad- just would not taste great after a week or 2 of use. But it would always take a long time 10-15 minutes to drain.

I decided to upgrade the process and bought a Baratza encore grinder and some fresh local beans. I started on 20 grind setting. When I did this, the drain got clogged and it took 20 minutes just to get to 8 oz even though I'm using 16 oz of water and there was still a lot of water just sitting at the top of the funnel. That was never an issue when using pre-ground and I feel like it was finer grind. I googled several similar articles and everyone says it needs to be coarser. So I gradually went up 2-3 settings up to 36 grind setting and nothing changed even though coarser. There's a lake of water at the top of of the filter every time and it takes 15-20 minutes and at the bottom of the funnel all of the grounds are concentrated, blocking the filter.

Admittedly, I don't have a scientific process. I grind 2 tablespoons of beans, I heat up 16 oz of water on the stove in a regular kettle (not gooseneck) until boiling, pour into Pyrex, let sit for 30 seconds, and then bloom for 60 seconds. Then pour the rest in and it just VERY slowly filters through until about 2/3 of the water is still at the top of the funnel. All the grounds are concentrated.

2. Pour some of the water (\~50ml) into the french press to preheat the press.
3. Leave the other water uncovered while doing the following 2 steps so that water cools down to 190  °F or 90  °C (because I have heard this is the best temp for coffee).
4. Grind 2 tablespoons of coffee beans.
5. Empty out the water from the french press and put the ground coffee in the french press.
6. Pour water slowly up to 200 ml mark and cover the lid.

Coffee,"Hi guys. Not sure if this question has popped up before but recently I’ve upgraded my hario mini mill to a timemore c2 and my coffee has become more astringent.

I’m brewing a v60 using Kurasu or April Coffee’s recipe. Mostly kurasu which is

Usually I get a really nice sweet cup with my hario grinder, and I thought that if I upgraded to the C2 I might get an ever better flavour to my cup because the grinds are more consistent. Using the same grind setting on the c2, my brews have become more astringent and I’m not sure why, I’ve tried tweaking a lot of things like brew time, agitation and grind settings but I have not got much improvement. It’s astringent even with a shorter brew time.

Coffee,"I've always struggled to find a FP brew that I really like with light-roast coffee. I usually have the best results with my Aeropress for that. So thought I'd share a method that turned out awesome.

I've always liked the idea of the Kruve sifter, but it was too expensive to be considered worth it for me. I stumbled upon a ""#60 mesh"" (250 micron) flour sieve on Amazon and thought it would be worth a shot for $12. Here's what I did and I think it turned out great:

\- 25 grams of coffee (post-sifted, I lost about 3 grams sifting)

\- Baratza Encore (standard burrs) at level 18

\- 300 grams of water at 100C

\- 4 minute steep (stirred a few times during)

\- Poured through a rinsed V60 filter (I hate chewy/muddy coffee and like to drink the last drop)

The cup was incredibly balanced, no bitterness and low acidity. It tasted how the beans smelled, if that makes sense, with nothing coming through that was unpleasant.

I did the brew twice identically, with the exception of sifting, and found the brew with 3 grams fewer fines to be better (same amount of coffee by weight for each).

Coffee,"Hi, this is my first post here. I recently bought a used espresso machine (a local Korean brand named Boral), which is classified here as a ""semi-automatic"" coffee machine. It has a small pressure gauge. For my grinder, I'm using a Baratza Maestro (Plus?), which I had calibrated to the finer setting, and the finest I can get my grind to can be seen from this image:  https://imgur.com/a/uWNd9VO The problem I have is with how the machine is extracting way too quickly (12\~15 seconds for a 1:2 ratio). Fresh beans and old beans same story. And so I imagined, from several google search results, that my grind is probably too coarse. And so, going against some people's advice, I tried using a food processor (blender) to get it finer and finer. The coffee became extra fine and the coffee machine started to choke (the pressure gauge with the Baratza grind only goes up to 5\~7 bars of pressure while going over 10 with the finer grind), with a minimum of 25 seconds of brew time and some going over 1 minute for a 1:2 ratio. But I've watched a few videos online and it seemed as if the grind they were using weren't much finer than what my Baratza grinder was putting out. And so finally the question I have is, is my grinder simply not enough? Or is it my espresso machine? (As in, would other espresso machines have good brew times with the type of grind I'm getting from my grinder). Thank you.

Coffee,"I won't bore you with the details of everything, but I put about 30-40 hours of sweat and 10-15 pounds of coffee into making it work for our household - from research, videos, dialing in the grind and tamp, dialing in the internal burrs/weight/flow/brew time, trying different roasts and blends/brands, seeking out advice all over the internet and even talking on the phone with Breville espresso experts who own the machine and whose job is tuning it to perfection - and it all failed to produce consistency.

I'm not saying it's not right for many people, but it definitely wasn't for us.

After the experience, I'd suggest that you have to have some pretty solid experience with semi autos before this will work for you. That or you might have to commit to a very long learning experience that went beyond my month of intense work with the machine.

To me, it wasn't quite the foolproof middle step between semi-autos and super-autos that I thought it would be. The biggest frustration was just the lack of consistency in the extraction from one shot to the next - even when I was able to get the basket to the precise extraction ratio with good flow. It was simply all over the place and I came to realize that at least one thing I read about the machine was definitely true: Even if I got it down to the exact right mix of factors, I was likely going to have to dial in the machine every single day to get the right shot or latte or Americano. Of course, there's nothing wrong with that if you have the time and patience.

Coffee,"Hello there, I own a Mr. Coffee Espresso Machine, its the ECMP50 and before anyone starts telling me that my machine is not worth it... I know, this is not a high end machine, I know its a budget machine, but its what I have a t the moment and its better than a steam pressure ""espresso"" maker that doesn't have a pump. I'm looking to squeeze some more out of this machine before moving to anything 700+ $ in price.

I want to do a couple of changes to this machine, for one I have ordered a new unpressurized filter, and will probably make it bottomless in time (extremely busy at the moment). Other than that, I've seen that the shower screen is, as no surprise, not good. The water groups up in the center making a stream and it doesn't shower as I would like to see it. I've seen people upgrade their shower screens for better ones but I cant seem to find one that is the same size as the one my machine has.

Here comes the question that I want to throw to the community: could I use a bigger shower screen on a machine like this one? It would not be in the way of the portafilter, not that I can tell anyway. The filter is 51mm ID and the shower screen is 47mm OD. could a 50mm shower screen work here? I'm guessing the other problem would be the screw that holds the screen in place, its 10mm diameter hole so I'm guessing that would be a big challenge as well. Any thoughts or help here would be much appreciated. I don't think Ill ever have a 2k$ machine so I'll take what I can get.

Coffee,"So I've been having trouble with a 6 cups chemex, brewing 23g coffee and 350g water (1:15). I have a baratza encore, with a goose neck kettle, and followed James Hoffman and Scott Rao's methods.
  
The problem is that a couple roasts I recently started using always taste sour when they cool down. It's not a floral/acidic note. It's almost like vinegar, and undrinkable. This only happens to some roasts (especially Keynote from Chromatic), and not the others. They are all medium roast btw. I've tried the brews from the cafes so I know what's the expected flavor, but it's definitely not what I'm getting.
  
I tried decreasing grind size (resulted in 7 min brew time!) and increasing grind size (resulted in about 4 min brew time) but both yield the same sour taste, though a little less so on the 7 min brew time.

Coffee,"Hi guys,

I seek the wisdom of you all, coffee addicts/masters/lovers.
Not so long ago I started my journey with coffee and I went from not caring about it as long as it had some caffeine to being a snob about how the coffee at a lot of places taste like dirty water...

Please help me not making any big mistake, I am about to get rid of my cheap grinder that worked really well (to my standard) up till now.
Although it grinds fine enough after I adjusted the burr, I am now fed up with the inconsistency and mess that comes with it.

Originally I planned to get a breville smart grinder, but after a quick trip to a local store, I’ve seen that the breville barista expert is also rather affordable.

Now I am happy with my little friend, breville bambino plus. But I am not sure whether it would be a better choice to swap the espresso machine as well and get a 2-in-1 or just upgrade the grinder?

Please help me making a good choice here.

Ps: do you guys know why breville is called sage in Austria?

Edit:
Thank you all, the decision was clear, I already got my sette 270 ^^ [HELP] Grinder upgrade or breville barista express",guys seek wisdom addicts masters lovers long ago start journey go caring long caffeine snob lot places taste like dirty water please help making big mistake get rid cheap grinder work really well standard till although grinds fine enough adjust burr fed inconsistency mess comes originally plan get breville smart grinder quick trip local store see breville barista expert also rather affordable happy little friend breville bambino plus sure whether would better choice swap espresso machine well get upgrade grinder please help making good choice guys know breville call sage austria edit thank decision clear already get sette help grinder upgrade breville barista express
Coffee,"In my local specialty cafe scene, only a few cafes use mesh filters (which are by CORES). It's probably trivial, but I also noticed these few cafes are Japanese-themed and also sell Japanese coffeeware such as Kinto and Rivers.

I'm wondering if the same goes to your local specialty cafes. Is there a reason why paper filters are more popular than mesh/metal filters in specialty cafes?

From what I've read, it is more of an espresso grinder than anything else, but does it do pour over well? Or is it better to get the non-pro version while I don't have an espresso machine? 

I'm inclined to buy once, buy right, and if the JX pro will do pour over well then that seems like my best purchase.

I’m new to coffee drinking - started a month ago but it has me pretty excited. 

I wanna get a semi-auto Espresso machine. For grinder im going with Eureka Mignon Specialita (unless you guys think that’s a mistake). 

With regards to the espresso Maschine, i was first thinking Profitec 300 (reasons were dual boiler, saturated ring group and price). Ive since decided against that due to boiler size (wanna be able to make an Americano from time to time, and head the steamer stuggles with maintaining pressure). 

The ones im looking at now are: 
- Lelit Bianca
- Rocket Mozzafiato Chronometro R
- Izzo Alex Duetto IV Plus
- Your suggestions

Use requirement: 
- A few shots every morning for me and my wife. 
- Occasional use for 4-8 people when having guests (post COVID that is)

I want a machine i can “grow” with, so we don’t end up feeling hampered by gear later off (buy cheap, buy twice). 

I feel all the machines would suit meet our demands just fine. Prices are around the same in my country (nordics). I find it hard to chose. 

What would you chose and why?

Coffee,"So I’ve had the C40 for nearly two years and in that time I’ve used it for pour over grind sizes about 35-40% of the time and the rest has been for espresso (8-11 clicks).

My method is an adaptation of James Hoffman's method. I take 250 ml of boiling water and place it on the clever dripper. Then I put 15 g of coffee straight into the clover dripper. I use a spoon to break up the crust on top and then I wait 2 minutes and 30 seconds. What's the time is over I drain for 30 seconds. And then wait another 30 seconds for the coffee to go ahead and brew in the cup.

Coffee,"Hi everyone.

First post... go easy on me!

I know the OT has been around a while now but I am interested to know what people's thoughts are on it?

I've had mine a week, I purchased it as I know nothing, although I have learned loads over the past week (theory wise).

I have a few questions, some of it is basic stuff.

The first beans I tried were the Lavazza Blue - Cream e Aroma - I went for cheaper beans whilst I got to grips with how to work the machine. I'll be honest, I'm not confident in my 'tasting' expertise and I never drink espresso's. I always drink high street coffee so I was aiming for 'accepted' variables when pulling the shots. 

The Lavazza beans were dialled in at:

Grind 17 - 30s Brew time - 44g out

Infusion was around 8 seconds. The OT manual says infusion should be 8-12 seconds. This gave me a thick crema. 

I had a barista mate coming around so I then, in a rush (to try different beans), bought 1kg of the Columbian Costa Beans, from Costa.

I had to switch the grind size right down to 3, run it for 32seconds to get 42g out. The infusion time was around 7 seconds, which seems short to say the OT was almost down to it limits.

Is this normal? It just seems extreme for the 2nd bean I have tried.

So I guess I want to know, if I stick to the 'mainstream' variables as a beginner will I be in the right ball park for a decent espresso to then put in a milk based drink. Ie infusion between 8 and 12 seconds, shot time 20 to 35 seconds. (The OT double shot time defaults to 30 seconds). I am overthinking this as a beginner?

The default heat is 93 degrees.

I only really drink high street coffee (up until now), I have some independent beans on order to try once I get quick at dialling in, but I was wondering what are the differences in taste for the Costa and Lavazza bean? I want to start registering and learning the differences/terms so I have a reference for the different tastes.

Apologies for the long post.

I also have a 1 on 1 course coming up with a local barista who teaches classes but it isn't for a while.

Coffee,"*So for a little bit of context, I'd like to give some background on the two plants in question, and I'd like for any tips or advice on how to help them recover/flourish.*

Relevant Info: Zone 6a and not at all a tropical level of humidity. Despite this the trees are flowering and producing minimal amounts of beans (I currently have 12 beans total over the past two years of ""production""). I'd like to increase this.

Here is a picture of the two coffee trees in question:

[https://imgur.com/a/tWj7oDd](https://imgur.com/a/tWj7oDd)

Story Time, I'll keep it short:

About 2 years ago I moved into an apartment complex where the prior residents left 3 small, dry, potted, and dying plants outside on the back patio (I didn't have any decorations so I figured why not try to revive them and keep them, without knowing what type of plant they were).

 At the time the plants were approximately 2.5 ft tall, had very sparse branches and dying leaves which were completely covered in aphids and other bugs. I moved in early fall, so the temperature had managed to shock the plant and nearly all of the leaves were shocked and fell off the branches excluding the top growth. One of the three plants succumbed to the weather and never recovered, but I managed to save the other two, which over the next year struggled, but experienced a good spring growth to about 4.5 ft. It lost a decent amount of leaves and even full branches due to the winter, the very dry climate inside the apartment, and overall my lack of knowledge that they were coffee plants in the first place (I still don't know what species they are to this day!).

Once they were done growing and seemingly more happy (If I recall correctly, one of the trees produced a few fruit at this point, which prompted me to upsize them), I repotted them again last spring into much larger 6.2 gal pots, and over the past year they completely rocketed in growth.

Today:

They now are both about 7 feet tall, They each had maybe 3 flowers between the two of them in February, and the past few months they have hundreds of buds now, with dozens of them ripening and ready to flower within the week (Yay!). Throughout this entire process I have been doing my best to humidify my apartment and prevent leaf loss, but its been very difficult especially in the winter. This past week I grabbed a humidifier (as you can see) to possibly this place humid enough, but I also have been spraying the leaves with a mister up to 3 times a day over the past few weeks. Despite that, it still starts to brown and a few leaves are drying out, much to my annoyance. Otherwise I am trying to help promote its branch growth because it seems to be doing fine growing upwards, but the base of the tree is really barren and funky looking due to its harsh revival. 

**Anyway, my main questions are these:** 

**Other than pinching the top growth, is there any way to help promote branch growth towards the base of the trees?** 

They are basically just stalks and I'd like it to try to repopulate their trunks, if possible. 

**Also, any other advice to prevent browning on the tips or completely dried out leaves?**

I'm doing whatever I can to keep the plants humid but it doesn't seem to like to keep its leaves completely green, is that just an unfortunate result of my location?

Either way I am hoping they will bloom and produce exponentially more fruit this year and would love any advice on increasing their branch volume and overall width/shape of the trees.

Coffee,"I don’t have an expensive burr grinder at home, I only have a cheap blade grinder that doesn’t produce consistent grind size.

My question - Is it worth buying pre ground coffee if the grind size is consistent? It usually lasts me a week, so buying it weekly is bad for the freshness?

Coffee,"I made a thread about losing sense of smell due to covid awhile ago, back in 2020 when I was originally infected, and I'm happy to say that over the last month I'm FINALLY starting to be able to piece together the notes of coffee once again.

COVID caused me to develop anosmia for a few weeks while infected, but even after that left me with paranosmia - my brain interpreted smells in a way that was different compared to how it did previously.

Because of this, for basically the last year coffee has basically smelled and tasted like weak instant coffee, no matter the roast or grind or brewing method. Freshly ground beans just smelled like the way used, damp pourover grinds used to smell.

A year and two vaccinations later, and coffee is coming back finally. As of right now, the main note I'm getting from coffee is peanut, but I'll take peanut over nothing any day.

Just thought I'd make this post in case any other coffee lovers lost their smell and didn't see it recover in a couple months - apparently it can still come back after a year : ) Almost exactly a year later after being diagnosed with COVID in early May 2020, my sense of smell finally has returned enough that coffee tastes/smells good again.",make thread lose sense smell due covid awhile ago back originally infect happy say last month finally starting able piece together notes covid cause develop anosmia weeks infect even left paranosmia brain interpret smells way different compare previously basically last year basically smell taste like weak instant matter roast grind brewing method freshly ground beans smell like way use damp pourover grinds use smell year two vaccinations later coming back finally right main note getting peanut take peanut nothing day thought make post case lovers lost smell see recover couple months apparently still come back year almost exactly year later diagnose covid early may sense smell finally return enough tastes smells good

The required parts should add up to less than $90. You will need to do a small amount of soldering in the assembly, but otherwise it can be put together with basic skills and tools.

Tools you will need:

1. Philips head screw driver
2. A sharp knife
3. Angle grinder of grinding wheel
4. Hot glue gun

Coffee,"I was looking through this Reddit for cold brew recipes, and found many suggestions for ratios, practices, steeping times etc.. So with all the research in mind I ground up my beans at course and was ready to start. There was one problem I ground up 93g of coffee beans to 500g of water. Mind you I was not planing to make a concentrated batch. Realizing my mistakes w the ratios (Should have been 32g for 500g of water) I was puzzled in finding a solution. Realizing that I was going to add cream (I know it’s a sin here), some caramel and vanilla. I decided to dilute my “concentrate” with a 1:1 ratio of water. Now my egotistical a$$ thought this was a great idea, don’t mind my logic but, I thought that this was 3x the grinds I needed, given the weight of the ice, sweetener and creamer I thought that having a 1:1 ratio of water to concentrate was a great idea. 1 third would be my add ons, 1 third concentrate, and 1 third water. I slept in it and realized it was dumb logic and did it anyways. Thus a happy mistake was made, I have never had a better cold brew in my life. That just goes to show how forgiving and easy cold brew is for a beginner. Thanks for the help guys! Will definitely be experimenting w proper ratios soon!

Coffee,"So, I recently started this whole coffee journey and I am running into some consistent issues. 

I buy coffee from a good/decent specialty coffee store and have them grind it. Usually I have them set the grinder for a pour over, as I mainly use a v60. The first day or two the coffee tastes amazing and it has a reasonable draw down time. However, after this the coffee doesn't necessarily go stale (I know it does, but I don't think that's the problem), but becomes really finicky? 

Draw down times become increasingly long and the filters become clogged (not the bed, the filter). The coffee also easily goes sour or bitter, depending on temperature. The beautiful floral notes typically get lost and we essentially end up with good supermarket coffee. Also, being off by two degrees with brewing water radically changes the resulting coffee.

Another issue I have is that there seem to be a lot of fines? When I use an aeropress it seems 30 to 40% of the puck is essentially mud-like in consistency. Now, I have had this experience with three different shops, although one seemed to have less of an issue (interestingly, the only ones who knew what a v60 was). Could it be that the local specialty coffee shops are just... Well, not that special? They also seem to have a funny notion of the concept of light roast. 

Anyway, the problem isn't so much the subpar coffee, but the difficulty in learning when it feels like my medium is constantly changing. Does anybody know what the hell is going on? And, does anybody know how to fix this? I have an aeropress and a v60, a 0.1 gram fast scale, as well as a thermometer that I use to get the temp of my water. So, all except a grinder and a pouring kettle.

PS. I am saving up for a grinder, so in the future this should be fixed. However, in the mean time I would like to not feel like I am wasting 3/4 of each bag of coffee.

My wife and I, along with our toddler, are renting a townhouse on the beach for a week and I am trying to decide on what to bring to make us coffee each morning.

On one hand, it’s my normal setup and I can make a batch of coffee quickly in the morning and just relax, but on the other having a slim set up (maybe v60 and hand grinder?) seems simpler and easier to take.

Coffee,"I've been struggling for 2 weeks to get a good cup of coffee with the new Comandate grinder and I've got bitter brews every time with the 4:6 method. I tried with hotter water and coarser grinds (94-96°C, at 23-26 clicks), I tried lowering the temps 1-2 degrees or going coarser and I never got good results, except once, at 94°C and 24 clicks. That one time, I could taste the chocolate liquor and raspberry notes of this specific coffee I have, but also a fair amount of bitterness but also sourness. For some reason, the bloom always left a puffy coffee bed, which I suspect was one of the main reasons for the unbalanced taste.

Yesterday and today I finally tried the roaster's recipe that they gave me but altering the ratio, since they use a pretty weird/strong one (1:13.75). I went to 1:16 and 1:17, but also going much finer, at 20-21 clicks and with the water at 91°C, against the advice of most people who tried to help me ""fix"" my brews (seems most people go for boiling hot water). Another interesting thing was that the bed is finally relatively flat after bloom and water doesn't just cut through it when I pour the 2nd pour.

And what do you know, I FINALLY got a balanced, pleasant cup of coffee. I'm posting the original image of the recipe and the English translation as text (automatic, might not be perfect). Remember, I went for the 1:16 then 1:17 ratio so I multiplied the weights roughly to 1.23.

**TL:DR; I've learned that sometimes grinding finer and using colder water works better and I should also try different recipes.**  


EDIT: Worth mentioning that this particular roaster does medium-light roasts most of the time.

Coffee,"With the temperatures going up I'd like to have iced coffee in the morning instead of using my french press. A local shop has a Yama tower and their tower iced coffee is just awesome, but I can't go every day. It's an almost viscous shot over ice, and unlike other iced coffee I've had. I've seen home slow drip systems under $60. Are these going to get me close to the Yama tower iced coffee?

Others have posted here that they've rigged up other systems, even using ice in a pour over overnight. Can I get a similar coffee out of putting ice in my pour over filter cone overnight?

Coffee,"Back in January I bought myself a [Nitrobrew.com](https://Nitrobrew.com) kit as Starbucks' Nitro Cold Brew was my favorite coffee outside of the house, and I wanted to up my coffee game inside of the house.  I brew more than a liter a day, and through lots of trial and error, I'm at a point where I want to share my cold brew success and methods with anyone who's interested.

**Grinder**

First, the grinder is key.  Last year I was using medium ground Starbucks Verona Decaf, which is way too fine for awesome cold brew.  I then thought I'd get a ""great deal"" on a conical burr grinder from Amazon and bought this [Sboly Conical Burr Coffee Grinder](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07Z8P348W/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1).  (It's bad, don't buy it)  Even at it's coarsest setting, it's way too fine for good cold brew.  I got my money back and decided to splurge a on [refurbed Baratza Encore](https://www.baratza.com/shop/refurb).  Well worth the extra money, and I did later upgrade this to the M2 burr, but I don't think that's necessary.  I'm finding my best success with grinding beans for cold brew at 35 (on the 1-40 scale of the Encore).

**Beans-Water Ratio**

I don't weigh my beans, which probably immediately has some people dismiss what I'll say next, but here's what works for me:  I brew my cold brew in [Hario Mizudashi](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IJ3PAIM?smid=A3JI8G7GLVJ8RK&amp;ref_=chk_typ_imgToDp&amp;th=1)s because they work phenomenal for brewing cold brew.  I fill the [filter](https://imgur.com/tfK0Ixc) all the way to the brim with whole beans, grind it at 35, and then [sift out](https://imgur.com/7oHt64Q) the majority of the fines, which leaves me just enough coarse ground coffee to cover all of the mesh in the plastic filter.  (This ends up being surprisingly consistent, and works well with various beans)

After sifting, I use the sifted grinds to make a pot of drip coffee with my cheap Mr. Coffee that I bought a decade ago.

**Water**

I definitely use cold filtered water from the fridge and fill it to just below the plastic ring for the handle.  I then put it in the fridge.

**Brew Time**

I brew this for 64-72 hours.  Basically whenever I finish drinking that day's cold brew, I get the next pot brewing so I can enjoy it three days later.  Three days sounds like a crazy amount of time, but the fines are what make cold brew bitter, and the coarse grinds being sifted make them work very well for a super long brew time.

**Beans**

I love coffee, and drink almost exclusively decaf.  I've tried several roasts from several brands, and have literally gone through about 50 lbs of coffee in 2021.  I will say that while CO2 decaf coffee can be great for drip coffee, all of the best success I've had with cold brew have been Swiss water process decaffeinated beans.  These are three of my personal favorites for cold brew:

[The Organic Coffee Co. Decaf French Roast](https://www.amazon.com/Organic-Coffee-French-Decaffeinated-2-Pound/dp/B000LKZKUY/ref=sr_1_6?dchild=1&amp;keywords=decaf+french+roast+organic&amp;qid=1620830282&amp;s=grocery&amp;sr=1-6)

[Subtle Earth Organic Decaf Medium Dark Roast](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07P89FR4W/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)

**Nitrogenating**

I mentioned it above, but I have the [16oz Nitrobrew.com Kit](https://nitrobrew.com/product/16oz-nitrobrew/), and I'm very happy with it.  As someone who uses it daily, I like not having to bother with a nitrogen tank or cartridges.

&amp;#x200B;

The big eyeopener for me was when I finally bought myself a Nitro Cold Brew at Starbucks last weekend...and was completely underwhelmed.  My brews are richer with a sweet dark chocolate taste that absolutely blows away the Starbucks offering.  The longer brew seems to bring out a rich, smooth, sweet flavor, and as long as the fines are sufficiently sifted out, the coffee is better as a result.

I'm sure there are other people who have methods that work better for them, but this is what I like, and I'm thrilled with how well it works for me.

Coffee,"I don't know when I started, but despite having a scale I almost always add an extra 0.1 - 0.5g of coffee ""just in case"". At this point it's become a habit, and it's like I don't even try to be accurate.

Coffee,"I wonder if anyone else has encountered this issue. In the past, I used 16g with my AP recipe. And I could plunge down smoothly. Pressure and sealing worked as expected.

Now that I use 11g, it seems like there's not enough pressure/sealing happening. Plunging isn't smooth. It's *notchy.* Sometimes, it even lets go and I end up pressing all the way down in like 10 seconds.

I wonder why that is. Other than that, coffee is super tasty. I just find it annoying. Could it be that my seal at the bottom of the plunger is too old? Should I change it?

Coffee,"I know probably not many are in the same boat but I’ve got a multi tap kegerator with a nitro tap, so I figured “why not?” and brewed a 5 gallon batch of cold brew to put in a nitrogen purged and then charged keg.  AWESOME thing to have on tap in your back yard, btw. 

I was really happy with it and assumed the nitrogen would keep it from oxidation and stay reasonably fresh for… well, however long it took to consume 5 gallons of cold brew, I guess.

After a couple of weeks it started to take on an acidic bite though and I ended up dumping the rest.  

Im wondering if anyone has any clue if that’s typical or if I maybe had a contamination issue or my supplier accidentally gave me nitro/ co2 blend (“beer gas”) or something else.

I may just need to cut down my batch size but thought I’d see is anyone has experience with this since the cold brew posts are really picking up this time of year in here.

Coffee,"Hi,

Was just wondering what to make of this coffee, *La Riviera - Culturing I* released by Devocion (NYC)? I only know some general stuff about what happens to coffee before I buy it in the bag and was wondering if others could weigh in i.e. if this practice described below is truly novel, if there are similar practices by other names, and any general thoughts / is it worth trying?

Below is the description from their website:

&gt;*Julio Madrid and his farm administrador Andrés Quiceno have developed a system of fermentation and microbiotic cultures for their coffees that are cutting edge in the coffee world. Borrowing from the beer industry, Madrid and Quiceno have concocted special recipes they call ""Culturing"" that promote certain microbiotic cultures to thrive during the coffee's post-harvest and pre-drying fermentation process. This not only helps emphasize different notes inherent in the bean's molecular structure, but also give remarkably potent profiles almost unseen in our years of cupping coffee.*   
&gt;  
&gt;*The first in our series of Culturing coffees from La Riviera brings fruit-forward profiles in coffee to another level, with notes of guava, cantaloupe and grapefruit, a distinct crème de cacao note, a rare saffron note and a rose oil profile in its fragrance.*

Coffee,"Decided I was ready to get 'serious' about coffee tasting.

FWIW, former homebrew competition beer judge here, so I have past experience.

Did 4 coffees, 8.5g, 150g water per SCA specs.

I felt like tasting the different notes (I hid the bags to avoid coloring my taste perception) was hard, way harder than beers. Tasting the roast level changes was much easier - one of the 4 was a darker roast and it was immediately noticeable. Two were both lighter roasted coffees from South America and TBH it was VERY hard to pick out differences. The fourth, a Kenyan, was *easier* but again not easy.

I used the same grind I use for press, but after breaking the crust \~4min in... they tasted weaker than expected. Perhaps this played a role too.

So, after doing this... I have questions.

\#1 - I can't tell if I've just blown out my taste buds from years of hot sauce and drinking, or if the subtleties are indeed harder, but I certainly hope this gets easier.

Coffee,"Hey /r/Coffee! I'm a huge fan of Starbucks' frappuccinos, so I've been trying to make my frappes taste as similar as possible. I have something that's reasonably close to their mocha cookie crumble frapp, and thought I'd share it with you. This is not what they use (e.g., they use frapp roast coffee which is their instant coffee, while I use espresso), but the taste is what matters.  

**You'll need:**  
* Medium-roast, freshly roasted coffee   
* 240mL (3/4 cup) milk  
* Milk chocolate chips, 1tbsp  
* Hershey's chocolate syrup, 50mL  
* Oreo cookies  
* Whipped cream  

**Prep:**  
* Spread Oreos on a plate, and freeze for at least 30 minutes.  
* Add chilled Oreos to a blender, blend to get cookie crumbs, store.  

**Recipe:**  
* Pull a single shot (or use half of a double shot) of espresso, brewed at an 18g:40g ratio  
* Add 9 ice wedges, milk, chocolate syrup, espresso, and chocolate chips to the blender (note: if you can't measure 50mL of syrup, it's roughly 7 swirls).  
* Blend until smooth, about 10s on a 900W blender.  
* In a cup, add whipped cream, a couple of swirls of chocolate syrup, and 1tsp of cookie crumbs. Add in blended frappe, and top with more whipped cream, chocolate syrup, and cookie crumbs.  

**Nutritional Info:**  
This recipe is around 340 calories with about 53g sugar, which is roughly on par with Starbucks' nutritional information (although slightly lower in calories). If you're logging this into something like Lose It!, my recipe shows 8.6g total fat of which 6.5g is saturated, 14.6mg cholesterol, 112.9mg sodium, 60.4g carbs, 3.9g fiber, and 6.5g protein.

[I was looking at VST basket and someone talked about using a microscope on a stock basket.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/ix9qv9/after_watching_james_hoffmann_discuss_performance/) [I have a stereo microscope that great for wide views at this scale.](https://www.amscope.com/stereo-microscopes/7x-45x-stereo-binocular-microscope-with-14-pillar-stand-64-led-ring-light.html) Like the other Redditor, to my naked eye, it looked fine. However, under the microscope, there were clearly massive issues.

Many holes were not even completely round and some were nearly closed. This is coming from a Gaggia Classic that I used for years. I noticed that with my bottomless portafilter, I would get random spraying. I thought this had to do with pressure but after looking at my images, it is clear to me that it is because the basket has holes that aren't round. The spraying would happen on one side of the basket. It just so happens that one of the sides of the basket has pretty severe issues with roundness.

I fixed this by doing the needle trick as well. In one of the images, I zoomed in significantly and you can see the little metal fragments. That was from me pushing the hole open with a sewing needle. To get rid of the fragments, I used a kitchen sponge to clean and polished it. Once I did this, I pulled a shot and found zero sprayings. The shot also tasted better too, there was less bitterness which I assume is coming from the more even flow of water over the puck.

In the close-up, you can see a lot of pitting around the holes. I am assuming this is wear since the machine is several years old and been used frequently. [James Hoffman in the comment mentioned this issue where old baskets get wider over time](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/ix9qv9/after_watching_james_hoffmann_discuss_performance/g65o183/). Pretty interesting to see it in action.

[Someone in the comments talked about paying attention to the exit side and pushing fragments into the exit side.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/ix9qv9/after_watching_james_hoffmann_discuss_performance/g66m500/) In one of the images, I flipped the basket over just to check it. This is after I needled the misshaped holes. Even though I fixed the worse offenders, you can see that the holes aren't all the same shape and some are slightly narrower than others. Some had fragments in them so removed them with the needle.

Overall, I am shocked at how bad my stock basket was. I am not sure what's the exact age of the machine but it's older than 2015. But I am impressed that pointing at the bad holes with a needle made a noticeable improvement.

But today I bought a 'Flat white' which is now in two sizes, so I bought the small flat white thinking it would just be an original flat white. Once receiving the drink it was the same size as what used to be a medium- to large cappuccino milk drink. Then I rememebed back to the last few drinks I have had, the sizes are all just getting extraordinary large, even the small. I find myself needing a kids size?

Coffee,"I bought a MBK Aerspeed at the start of the year. Up until recently it was very smooth when turning the handle, but in the past few weeks it has become rough and occasionally seems to catch. I am generally using it at \~2:4, so not particularly fine. Sometimes it runs perfectly smoothly, but I can't identify what makes this happen.

I noticed that there seems to be lateral play in the spindle, but I'm not sure if it's always been like this. Looking at the base the central burr does move with this play.

I may be imagining it, but there seems to be more fines- when brewing with v60 there seems to be more sludge sticking up the sides of the filter.

Coffee,"My dad has a Breville coffee machine that grinds the beans and brews it via drip. I use a french press and a blade grinder, coarse grind. 

 I tried a medium-dark roast with cherry overtones and I couldn't really taste the cherry at all, it just tasted like mediocre coffee so I gave it to my dad to try. He made me some today and I could absolutely taste the cherry, and it tasted way better than when I make it. Both times a tiny bit of cream and sugar were added. 

What's the difference? Is it the grinder in his coffee machine vs my blade grinder? How can I bring out the flavors more?

I've been brewing with an Aeropress + a Timemore C2 for about 9 months now, I love the coffee that I can make with this combination (I used to brew inverted before I watched James Hoffmann's videos on the Aeropress).

Coffee,"All,

Shortly after I dialed in my coffee (16.3:1), my scale (1 gram increments) quit working, and I had to replace it. I originally tried a Jennings CJ4000, and then switched to a Brewista Ratio Scale.

I have been following the Coffee Compass, and I am looking for feedback.

A. 16.08:1 (20 grams and 321 grams water): overpoweringly strong, though not bitter.

B. 16.4:1 (30 grams and 492.1 grams) Difficult to position at first, but sour as drink cooled

C. 16.7:1 (30 grams and 501.2 grams): Salty

D. 17:1 (28.2 grams and 479.2 grams): Difficult to position on the compass, bland, generic coffee taste

E. 17.42:1 (27.7 grams and 482.7 grams): Sour 

I have enough coffee in this bag to do another two (if not three) attempts and am hoping to get some feedback. I believe I have been following the coffee compass correctly, and with each try am getting ""less coffee"", but it seems odd how I had perfected it at 16.3 grams and am getting closer to 18?

Coffee,"I have had the Baratza Encore for around a year now, and I hadn't cleaned it in... well... I hadn't cleaned it. Over the past few months I noticed a significant decline in my v60 brews, most noticeably an increasing stale taste. I was first suspicious of my beans, but they're roasted locally and usually around a week from roast date. So I started agonizing over my technique, trying different things, going crazy over it. Around that time I noticed that I had been getting significantly more fines than I used to, which made for an unbalanced cup. The grinder! I can't believe I didn't think of it sooner. I gave it a good deep clean with the brush and some compressed air and got rid of a surprising amount of old coffee grounds (no wonder my coffee tasted stale). I can't BELIEVE the difference it makes. Fresh tasting, balanced, finally getting the fruity notes I've been missing from my favorite Ethiopia. If you've been unsatisfied with your coffee lately, ask yourself when the last time you cleaned your grinder is?

Coffee,"Hey everyone I'd like to brooch A subject that is often debated but more importantly can be a little sensitive to those who really appreciate well made coffee brands. 

I've spent 20 to 30 years of my life drinking wine (back to coffee in a minute) and finally coming to appreciate more expensive wines then a cheaper bottle. I'm not sure if my taste buds/pallet have simply changed or that I have simply just realized that cheaper made/produced/grown products are just not as good. 

I would actually like to introduce the argument that I have forced myself to enjoy a more expensive bottle rather than realizing the taste was less desirable over the years. And I soon began desiring the more expensive of the two. 

The same I believe happened with beer. I literally grew up very poor, watching my father drink malt liquor, among other cheaper watered down beers. I actually still don't mind the taste every once in a while. In fact many of us will agree that when we get together sometimes with friends and because more expensive beers are just that... expensive, we tend to see people purchasing Miller, Bud light etc. (mass produced, always on sale, somewhat watered down) because of course, they're buying it for 50 people.

With that said, I can't seem to spend the money for very expensive coffees because I just don't see the need to pay 3-4 times the price. Whether it be McDonald's vs Starbucks or Folgers (on the store shelves) vs ""name your brand"" high end/premium coffee, special ordered through the mail. 

Like most people I do enjoy a good cup of coffee (What i call good) and even sometimes buy some of the very expensive brands, but on a regular basis, even though I've been a coffee drinker for decades I don't feel the need to spend money on what are sometimes very inflated coffee prices. After purchasing $4-$6 cups of coffee, Is it just too hard to drink something that is less expensive? is the taste really subpar? Has advertising and peer pressure forced some people to continue paying for the expensive cup? 

I don't want this to be a debate about the amount of money it costs to produce coffee. And it's really not about the barista/micro producers if that's the correct term I'm thinking of. I'm referring mainly to the larger companies and producers. Coffee for the masses.

So my question is......Somewhere between ""dirt cheap"" and ""insanely expensive"" Do you think everything is actually just taste and preference? I would argue that it is. Many people really get down on others because they enjoy McDonald's coffee or a cheap white Zinfandel from the grocery story. If you stop at Starbucks, Caraboo, Tully's...Whatever, in the morning, then you're ""young and hip"". But the old guys still drinking Maxwell house and Folgers from donut town are nuts.
I would love to have anyone's thoughts and opinions.

Coffee,"I'll start off by saying that I have looked through old posts already and have tried many of the suggestions I found with lackluster results.  So hopefully I can get some more specific help.

My roommate and I have been trying to get a decent cup of coffee out of a french press for the past few weeks and everything we've tried comes out sour.

The least sour brew that we've gotten so far was doing the following:

1:12 ratio (per honest coffee guide)

* 15g medium roast coffee (ground at 26 on an Encore with upgraded burrs)
* 180ml water at 210 F 
* stirred at 1min
* let brew for 7 more mins
* The press and mug were warmed up before use.

We're reluctant to brew larger batches at this time after wasting so much coffee at the beginning just trying to dial it in.

Adjustments that I've tried: cooler water (&lt;200F), hotter water (&gt;210), coarser grinds, more water (ranging from 190-250ml), more coffee (16-18g), more time (longest brew was 10mins), and several types of coffee (mostly lighter roasts).  All sour.

Based on what I've found in my searches is that it sour b/c it's under-extracted.  So, should we go finer? (26 is already finer than what we brew in the drip machine). Brew longer than 8 mins total?  Or are we just doomed with this method?  I'll note that we don't have this issue with our drip brewer, every coffee I've tried in there has come out decent at worst so I don't think it's the coffee or the grinder. I don't want to throw in the towel just yet but it has been a frustrating journey so far.

Coffee,"I had to switch to decaf recently, and I've gone through a number of different roasters, looking for good coffee that I actually enjoy. Figured I'd pass on what I've had so far.

\-First and foremost, I have to send a shout out for Centri coffee, out of California. I was really impressed with their French roast decaf, which tastes dark, but still has a bit of sweetness to it, which isn't typical for what I usually find. And the free shipping is a huge perk. And their customer service has been great. There was a glitch on a recent order, and when I (politely) brought it to their attention, they really went above and beyond to make sure I was well taken care of. I don't typically say that, but they really did. I won't go into details about any of it, because internet, but Will was just amazing. They clearly value their individual customers. 

\-Kicking Horse decaf was very, very good. It's a darker roast. One thing I've noticed is that darker roasts seem to hold up better as decaf coffees. 

\-Laid Back, by Thou Mayest coffee roasters. It's a lighter roast, that was really, really smooth. This one was very reminiscent of the 24th Street blend that I had from Parisi roaster, back when I was doing caffeinated coffee. Both roasters are in Kansas City, so maybe there's just something about KC? I'll be ordering decaf from Parisi, soon, too. 

\-Old City in Philadelphia was really good, too. They have a few blends that were decaffeinated using a new-ish CO2 process, which tasted a little better than some of the water-processed blends that I've tried. Arrived within 2 days, I think , and had all been roasted after I'd placed the order. Another perk: They offer smaller (1/2-pound) size bags, which was great for ordering a sampler of everything they had on offer. They also have 8 different kinds of decal, including an Ethiopian and Sumatran. I haven't tried all of them yet, but considering most places seem to offer maybe one or two kids of decaf, this was really good to find. I'd forgotten until just now that they had so many others that I haven't tried yet...

\-Raven's Brew house blend and Skookum were pretty decent, as early finds went. But I was comparing them to Peet's, which is just undrinkable. I don't know if Peet's actually hates their customers, or what, but that cup was awful.

Coffee,"Unintentional but I started a cold brew last Thursday. I rarely make cold brew because over the years I've come to dislike it. A lot of times it tasted like oxidized coffee. I've tried making it with both fresh and older coffees. Mainly with darker roasts. 

Anyway onto the experiment. I had some Regalia Gatomboya AA that's a bit past its prime for espresso and I didn't really like it as a drip. So I decided to make a cold brew out of it. I had around 98g of it left. Perfect for my brewer which recommends 100g to 1 liter (dilute afterwords). However in this case I didn't dilute. I drank it straight (1:10 ratio). 

Tasting notes 
12 hours later: It was a bit sour and thin, I was really disappointed. Back in the fridge. 

24 hours: A bit more sour. I decided to add some oat milk and syrup to see if it'll taste good. It just tasted like water after I added it. I kinda gave up at this point and didn't try it again for a few days. 

3 days later: Not much of a difference, maybe a bit more body. 

7 days later: At this point I had maybe 12 oz left sitting with the grinds. The problem with this experiment is the less cold brew I had, the less contact the coffee had with the grounds. I have one of the brewers with a tube shaped container for the grounds which attaches to the screw on lid. 

I poured about half out and took a small sip. I was very confused. It tasted like very floral honey mixed with lemon juice, delicious. Even smelt like floral honey. It honestly tasted like an intensified version of how the fresh beans smelt which is amazing! It was honestly a better representation of what the coffee should taste like than the shots I've pulled and the few cups of drip I had made. In an espresso it has a strong herbal note. As a latte I can taste it a bit better, maybe cardamom? 

I wouldn't say that this is a full proof way to make cold brew with all light roasts but it worked out this time. One thing that I can't account for if I want to repeat this experiment is the air trapped inside and if that contributed to this flavor. Normally I'd want as little air as possible in the brewer but this time there was a lot of space for air which resulted in this magical last cup of cold brew. What I can probably recommend is to let light roast cold brew sit longer than the conventional 12-24 hours generally meant for darker roasts. 

I've tried this experiment with darker roasts before because one of my coworkers apparently loves dark roast sludge lol. I couldn't drink it past two days. It tasted like oxidized coffee which technically is all cold brew. That's why cold brew isn't my thing to begin with, over 90% of the time it tastes like oxidized coffee. 

What's your experience with light roast cold brew and what sort of tips do you have? I'm very interested. The reason I liked cold brew in the first place was because I had a very pleasant acidic / sweet cup once at a large chain cafe here in the US. Sadly that would be the only good cup of cold brew I'd have at a cafe.

Coffee,I used to own a $16 grinder from amazon that used to do this but I assumed that it was normal since it was bad quality and I just adjusted whenever I noticed it was getting coarse. Now I own a timemore G1 but I still have the same problem. I'm guessing that it's getting coarser when I grind beans because of the resistance but I'm not too sure. Is this normal? My hand grinder keeps grinding coarser beans the more I use it. Is this normal?,use grinder amazon use assume normal since bad quality adjust whenever notice getting coarse timemore still problem guessing getting coarser grind beans resistance sure normal hand grinder keeps grinding coarser beans use normal
Coffee,"Shortly after graduating college and getting my first big boy job, I got hooked on oat milk for coffee drinks. My first time trying it was at Greenway Coffee here in Houston, TX for anyone who may know the spot. I was kinda blown away from the first sip how delicious it was, not as a milk alternative but just in general. 

Since then, I've gone out of my way to try out various oat milks and recipes at home for coffee drinks using it. Maybe I can save a few of y'all some time or headache in trying the more mediocre brands so you won't waste as much of your quality beans on it.

For some context, the majority of the drinks I've made have been espresso-based but I've tried them with brew also and they're usually also good. 

Elite Tier: **Oatly Full Fat** (9.8/10) - My all around go-to for everything coffee. At $5 for 64oz, its pricey but well worth it IMO. Delicious, full-bodied flavor that cuts well for everything from hot capps to iced vanilla lattes to even breakfast cereal. My go to for this milk is a 1:1 cortado, highlights the bean you use while also having the delicious oat milk flavor. It steams pretty nice as well, and I've gotten very solid art from this. 7g of sugar per serving, so not Keto-friendly but not as bad as most oat milks. This is what got me started with oat milk, as its what the kind lady @ Greenway introduced me to. I usually buy these in 2 or 3.

**Pacific Barista Series** (9.4/10) - My go-to for iced espresso drinks. This is a cut above even Oatly full fat for iced flat whites or lattes (it's starting to get hot in Texas so I've been loving the stuff). It has a distinctly nuttier flavor than Oatly, but is not as smooth in contrast. The nuttier flavor goes amazing with ice, really bringing out the ""crispy"" element of iced drinks. 3g sugar per serving, very very low for oat milk maybe even keto friendly (not sure). A bit pricey, ($3.50-4.50, 32oz) so I only use it for iced stuff. Best steaming out of anything I've tried also, makes art almost as well as whole milk. It is shelf-stable so feel free to buy a 10-pack if you love it and want more value. Shoutout to The Nook @ UH for showing me this stuff.

**Oatly Barista Blend** (9/10) - I rarely purchase this variant since it's expensive and not crazy different to their full fat ($4, 32oz where I live). Tastes maybe a smidge better than Oatly full fat, but does steam better. Since I'm no latte art expert, this wont apply as much to me, and I cant justify the price for just better art.


Solid Tier: **Simple Truth Organic** (7.6/10) - I usually avoid Kroger because of its predatory nature and how they treat employees, but they do make a very solid value oat milk. Creamy and full-bodied like Oatly full fat, but not as refined and smooth. Steams well enough for the money ($3, 64oz) and packs a solid flavor while at it. Good enough for iced and hot drinks, but not great with either. I think 7g sugar/serving.

**Oatly Regular** (6.5/10) - Not too much to say about this since I never buy it anymore, but I'm sure it's healthier (?). Almost as flavorful and almost as full-bodied, but it always leaves you wanting something more. If you use this, I recommend hot drinks as iced will come out thin-bodied.


Meh Tier: **Califia Oat** (5.6/10) - I wanted to like this one more since their almond is my favorite. But alas, they screwed it up and its not great. Thin bodied, not a great flavor, nothing to make it seem distinctly ""oat"" to be honest. Just get their almond and be happy IMO.

**Oatly Low Fat** (5.2/10) - At the same $5 as full fat, why buy this? Maybe if you're sensitive to the ingredients in full fat, that would make sense. Mediocre oatmilk IMO, not my thing, buy something else if its in stock.

**Planet Oat** (5.2/10) - It'll do if the store you're at is out of everything else, but you'll definitely be settling. At $3.50 it's awful value IMO, but sometimes it'll be on sale for $2, and then its ok enough. Decent for hot drinks, crappy for iced.

**Dream Oat Beverage** (5/10) - At I believe $2.50 for 32oz, its a decent value at even normal price. However, thats all it has going, the flavor is ok, body mediocre. It is shelf stable though.

**HEB Oat** (4.3/10) - I live and breathe HEB-brand items but they screwed the pooch on this one. Pretty bad flavor and body, tastes watered down. All around not their best offering, hope they work on it so I can eventually enjoy it like 99% of their stuff.

**Chobani Oat** (4/10) - I really like their greek yogurt so I thought their oat ""beverage"" would be good too. It wasn't, not worth much discussion its meh and will probably never be better than meh.

**Kirkland Signature** (3/10) - This one really achy breaks my heart, because I love costco and the kirkland brand. Their pesto is like crack for me, but I don't think they've done enough ""QC"" with their oat milk. My batch came out watery, too sweet and steamed really badly. It's very cheap, like most kirkland items, but not up to snuff like their chocolates, cheese and breads. Shelf stable tho.


Hot Garbage: **Silk Oat Yeah** (1.5/10) - Not good enough for your cat, maybe if there are roaches at your house that need some calcium. Awful flavor, awful body usually priced at $3.50, on sale for $2.50 but its still trash. *Maybe* buy it if everything within 50 miles is out of stock, but even then there's always normal soy-based Silk which is actually decent. I think they recently stopped being ""oat yeah"" maybe cuz people knew how bad it was, no idea.

**Pacific non-Barista Series** (0.3/10) - This is bar none the worst oat milk, actually worst overall milk I've ever tasted. Ridiculously sweet, zero body and no distinctly oat flavor. It made me waste 2 good shots of beans to it, and then had to go back to sprouts just to return it and get oatly. I have NO idea how their barista and non-barista series are SO different. One is elite and best overall for iced, and one is not even good enough for most species of roach. Boomer bile probably tastes better. Gross.

TLDR: Oat good, me like

Coffee,"Forgive me if this is considered a low effort question, but after doing research I am still stumped. 

I recently purchased the pink bourbon as well as some Ethiopian and Tomato basil Colombian coffees from Vibrant Coffee roasters. I usually use medium to darker roasts, and I brew almost exclusively on a clever dripper or aero press. I have heard that Vibrant coffee tends to roast on the lighter side.

My question: how the heck am I supposed to brew it so it tastes good? I used 15 grams of coffee, 230ml of water. How I generally brew my coffee is around a 12-14 on the Baratza Encore, pour water just off the boil into my dripper and put my coffee in, stir, brew for 2:30, break crust, and draw down at 3:00. For the pink bourbon I ground at 8-9 (don’t ask me why I thought it was a good idea to go that low) and as a half expected, it was horribly over extracted. The second time I tried 10-11 grind and 2:45 draw down, it was horribly under extracted.

Coffee,"Hello Everyone,

Currently I use a Chemex, a French Press and a Bodum Pour-Over with the Chemex being used for the  95% of my brews, the French Press for the remaining 5% and the Bodum Pour-Over virtually never (never managed to get a cup of coffee I enjoyed out of it). Lately I was looking into adding a V60  to the roaster and was wondering if it's actually worth it. What I mean is, am I missing on something or is that flavour profile already covered by the brewers I already use? Can't really find a Chemex-V60 taste comparison (beside an exceptionally well made video by Seattle Coffee Gear). From what I could gather the V60 would give me a fuller, slightly bitter brew opposite to the smoother, crispier Chemex for the same beans/grind. Am I getting it right?

Since it's obvious I'm gonna to grab one no matter what (when you're looking into a new toy you've already decide for it XD) here's a few questions:

1- 01 or 02? I usually brew around 300-350ml (just for me) with 20-22gr of beans.

2- Is it worth getting the full kit/set or just the brewer (without the decanter) is much handier?

Coffee,"I’ve recently gone from an iced coffee hater to being in love w Japanese iced coffee (thanks to the god himself, James Hoffman). 

Anyway, I was reading an article about it, and this article claimed the Japanese iced coffee is better than cold brew bc it extracts more of the flavors, which is obviously true, but then it said it’s even better than a standard pour over because the ice “locks” the flavors in. Is that... can that be true? Or at least an accurate way to describe what’s happening? Idk that language is just really weird to me. 

Is there anything about quickly cooling off coffee that “locks in” the flavors, other than getting it to a drinking temperature while it’s really fresh?

Coffee,"A couple of months ago I asked the sub for equipment advice. Thanks to everyone who chipped in!

A quick update. I went ahead and bought the following:

1 Sage Barista Pro.   
Pretty happy with this, I don't always get spot on extraction times, but I do get a decent drink every time and my wife is okay with it. I tend to empty the hopper each time, weigh in c. 18g of coffee and go from there. Dialling the grind size and temperature is easy, but perhaps due to my tamping, results are a little variable still. My only solid criticism of the machine is the overspill of coffee during grinding. I Haven't tried the steam wand yet.

2. A 1zpresso JX-Pro grinder. To date I've only used that for Chemex, my espresso is good enough for me with the built in sage grinder, but I have the option for finer tuning of my grind if I want it. I find it fiddly to set the dial, but once done it is easy to use and clean.

3. Chemex. Really enjoy this coffee too, the process is quite therapeutic. Overall consistency is reasonable. I also bought a kettle and scale to complete the kit. 

Next purchase is an aeropress to allow me to make decent coffee when I travel.

Coffee,"first post, sorry if this belongs in a different thread.

I just upgraded to a goose-neck kettle with temperature gauge on top lid (Wenegg).  with my technique I've had some coffee that tastes better than ever before. But  after about 6 times in my new kettle, my last two pours have tasted almost like straight water I can't figure out what's different.

&amp;#x200B;

using a JX-pro grinder coarseness  44.75.

Alternate between a medium and light roast, both have had tasted great with this.  Both still have aroma when opening the bag.

Measuring 10.4 g for 12 oz water (I know it's weak, but it used to be perfect flavor strength for me before.)

My kettle temp gauge has a ""green section"" for pourover I notice it doesn't stay in there during the whole pour, so I'll heat it during the pour to keep the gauge in the green.  I wonder if the gauge is accurate, it seems the needle can jump around, and the water can end up coming out sputtering.

pour very slowly, just enough for an initial bloom, wait until I can see the grounds, and then only add enough to cover grounds.  usually spiraling outside in, then after that just cover spots that seem neglected.

This brewed amazing cups, but the last 2 have tasted almost like straight water.  What's different??

Coffee,"I have only done this with one coffee, but based on recommendation to do it in the first place, plus the outcome, I am confident this will work - using water profile to control brew.

First, I have been using Third Wave Water, per instructions for about 15 months.  Thinking back, my coffees have not been very bright while using it.  Recently, while brewing and drinking a coffee that was very good using Third Wave Water as instructed, I found it to not be bright at all, so much saw I wondered about it, especially since its advertised tasting notes are Winey / Forest Berries / Floral.  My V60 brews of this coffee were consistently smooth, rich, mellow and sweet.   Great coffee but pretty much polar from how the roaster described the coffee.

In my review of the coffee, I pointed out that situation in the 'What are you brewing this week"" thread.  Someone stated it is probably my water, and after I replied I was using Third Wave Water, the person stated that it is fairly high in mineral content and buffer - on upper end of SCA recommendations on both, further recommending I dilute it.  The next day, I cut the prepared water with straight distilled water 50%/50%, weakening it about 50%.  Next brew was exactly as the tasting notes: floral, bright and winey tart. I have done four more brews, and all have been bright, versus the mellow smooth of my first five brews with this coffee. 

This makes sense - more buffer will weaken the taste of the acidity.  Also, for people who make their own water or use Third Wave Water or other additives, this is an easy tool to control brews.   Want a mellow, more traditional smooth coffee, use a prepared water profile at full strength.  Want a more bright coffee, dilute it.  This seems to be a very easy way to tweak coffee to your preferences.

Coffee,"Lately, many of my recent purchases were disappointing. The nearest roaster is a third wave roaster, they sell a variety of single origin roasts for a semi-hefty price. When i first started trusting them, they always had some of the freshest roasts available near and they were all pretty much spot on. But recently, in the past 3 months this hasn't been my experience. I kept getting coffee to would go stale barely 5 days after opening a bag or i would get batches with defects in them. I store the beans properly in their own bag (they have a valve) and make sure no oxygen remains in the bag. and i also transfer them in a airscape container half-way through as well. Upon closer inspection, i realized most of the bags i was given were at the minimum already a month old and most beans i buy are not light roasts, so the coffee did taste boring. Usually i would get bags roasted 5 days prior to my purchase but now the average roast date is a month.

This isn't the only thing i noticed, i bought their cheaper bulk beans last week because i told myself it wasn't worth spending 22 bucks on a bag if it wasn't fresh enough. To my surprise, the beans tasted fresher and had far better blooms. And this, is the reason i'm considering switching to another roaster that will provide me with the freshness i expect out of the price i pay for my bags.

The problem, and reason, why i made this post is because i don't know how to approach them and give them a legetimate feedback without being rude or sounding spoilt. I'm introvert and when i'm disappointed in something i tend to poorly express myself and i come across as a whiny individual. I'd like to let them know why i'm disappointed with the recent purchases without going too far or sounding spoilt. With their bulk beans providing better coffee and their more expensive specialty single origins going downhill in quality, i feel the need to let them know.

I know the pandemic is hard for all roasters but many other roasters near, are still able to provide fresh beans for a comparable price. If every roaster around was in this situation i would just deal with it, but it's not the case, many still provide quality goods despite the pandemic.

Coffee,"I swear to gloib, I think Chemex bonded filters are suddenly made differently than they were pre-COVID. 

After buying some filters at Whole Foods last year, my brew times (for years before this) went from a quick-draining 4 minutes to a lingering, unmoving 7-8 minutes, no matter what I do. I've done a lot of experimenting to rule out everything else, even trying a years-old filter at my girlfriend's mom's place (she never uses her Chemex!) and watching it drain nice and fast like I'm used to. But it comes down to this batch of filters I bought at Whole Foods over the last year or so...just much, much slower. 

Anyone else notice newer Chemex filters are suddenly really slow? I swear their manufacturing process must have changed since the pandemic has for some reason greatly affected the paper product industry. And if anyone has bought filters in the past year and they seem normal, I'd love the know what kind and where you got them!

Coffee,"For my coffee making, I finally started considering what water I was using, since coffee is mostly water - probably some of you have also gone down this rabbit hole.

There is no shortage of material online about 'water recipes' for coffee, where demineralized water (distilled or RO) is remineralized for optimum coffee brewing, but few of these resources were interested in really explaining the math and chemistry that was used, and in a lot of cases the math seemed suspect or inconsistent when comparing different people's water recipes.

So I decided to learn the chemistry and do the math myself. I expected to get better coffee, but I ended up having a lot of fun learning about things like alkalinity and molar weights and weirdness about how 'parts per million' is measured. And I learned that a lot of the inconsistencies that I'd seen online were from people not specifying the specific stuff that they are adding - writing just 'calcium chloride' isn't super helpful when it's available in both hydrous and anhydrous forms, each of which contribute a different amount of calcium per gram used.

I'm a professional musician and teacher, so I don't really use chemistry or math in my career, but I loved science growing up and it's been really fun to have a hobby where I can rediscover that love! Any other amateur chemistry nerds here?

**It's very possible that I've done some bad chemistry or math myself, but here's the recipe that I'm currently using.**

To a 5 gallon jug of RO water, I add 1.89g of potassium bicarbonate (the classic RPavlis recipe, but scaled up to a 5 gallon jug of water, since that's what I have on hand) - I use this water by itself for espresso.

For filter coffee, I add a 'general hardness' concentrate. The concentrate is 500ml of distilled or RO water, 9.86g epsom salt, and 5.881g calcium chloride dihydrate. I add 5ml of this concentrate to each liter of the RPavlis espresso water to make water for filter coffee. This results in about 40 ppm magnesium hardness and 40 ppm calcium hardness. I'm still experimenting with the best balance of magnesium and calcium, as well as the best mineral sources to get magnesium and calcium; I'm a little concerned about the 80ppm of chlorides that this recipe gives, but so far I haven't had any corrosion problems in my stainless steel electric kettle Coffee reawakened my inner science nerd",making finally start consider water using since mostly water probably also go rabbit hole shortage material online water recipes demineralize water distil remineralized optimum brewing resources interest really explain math chemistry use lot cases math seem suspect inconsistent comparing different people water recipes decide learn chemistry math expect get better end lot fun learning things like alkalinity molar weights weirdness parts per million measure learn lot inconsistencies see online people specify specific stuff add writing calcium chloride super helpful available hydrous anhydrous forms contribute different amount calcium per gram use professional musician really use chemistry math career love science growing really fun hobby rediscover love amateur chemistry nerds possible do bad chemistry math recipe currently using gallon jug water add potassium bicarbonate classic rpavlis recipe scale gallon jug water since hand use water espresso filter add general hardness concentrate concentrate distil water epsom salt calcium chloride dihydrate add concentrate liter rpavlis espresso water make water filter results ppm magnesium hardness ppm calcium hardness still experiment best balance magnesium calcium well best mineral sources get magnesium calcium little concern ppm chlorides recipe gives far corrosion problems stainless steel electric kettle reawaken inner science nerd

Coffee,"I have a few questions, based on possibly silly observations. Through recently purchasing this kettle have noticed two things: 

1. The lower the volume of water (usually sub 400ml), the less chance of landing on desired temp (can overshoot by 3 - 5 degrees Celsius).
2. If the Kettle has been recently boiled, will also overshoot desired temperature (again, by 3 - 5 degrees.

When it is filled more than half way and hasn't been boiled recently, seems to work fine. Which is okay, but don't really want to be boiling more than I should be!

Would really appreciate feedback from other users whether they have experienced this with the Stagg EKG or not.

Coffee,"Debating between the BPB and the Moccamaster.  The cold brew option interests me, as we typically switch from hot to cold in the summer and it seems cleaner/easier than setting my Toddy on the counter.

I'd like to make 40oz of finished cold brew a day.  My understanding is that the BPB takes only 20oz of water, leaving you with some smaller amount of finished product.   But is that concentrate that comes out?

Coffee,"So, long story short I've been working on upgrading my coffee set up and the most recent change was going from a Timemore C2 to a Breville Smart Grinder Pro.

My espresso machine is a DeLonghi Dedica with a bottomless non-pressurized portafilter. 

My usual setting with the C2 was an 11 with 15g with fresh roasted to less than a month and a half old and we'd get some killer results from it.

Coffee,"Ok so a little backstory. I've used a clever a few times a week for the last few years and found myself always grabbing back for a v60 or a french press. The clever had weird drawdowns, james hoffmans coffee first method was a pain with getting consistency imo and I found the filters to not fit super well. When my clever broke I was bummed, but thought I might as well try another immersion/perc method. So I picked up the hario switch. Here are all the improvements I have found.

GRIND
-I have found the grind size on switch can be much finer, creating a sweeter cup without stupid long drawdowns, even going coffee first. I have yet to have a really bad cup

FILTERS
-Being able to play with v60 filters from cafec to hario untabbed has been really fun haha. I've found the best middle ground to be the cafec traditional but it's been fun to see the difference between filters. So many options

DRIPPER
-The clever seemed to retain a bit of water in it, but the hario just feels so much more streamlined
-The switch is so much better for experimenting than the plug on the clever

--
Overall, I've been very happy with the switch and don't understand why I would ever switch back. Once it's wildly available in the U.S it's definitely worth a buy.

Coffee,"I got a Comandante last week and bought a bag of beans, roasted 6 days ago.
I almost got the last coffee I had right with the Comandante at 22 clicks so I tried this one at 23 clicks. V60, 22g of coffee, 1:16 ratio, the 4:6 method, water at ~93°C. It smelled great, I took a sip and... the taste was kinda bad but an EXTREMELY bitter aftertaste.
The bloom looked kinda awkward. I don't think I ground it too fine because the draw-down was rather quick (I was used to a much slower one, with a worse grinder).
I brewed another one with 15g of coffee and water ~92°C and it's better but still tastes a bit bitter and kinda bland.
Yet another one, 15g, 2 clicks finer because the second one tasted kind of under-extracted when it got colder and with the water at 90°C, it's still bitter, tastes pretty much the same. 

I'm still surprised how quickly the water flows through and how good it smells, when the taste is so off. 

Is this coffee just too fresh to brew? Am I missing something else?

Coffee,"So I recently started trying to roast coffee beans for the first time.

I did some research on what I could use to roast the beans and decided to go cheap, so I found a Stir Crazy popcorn machine like this: https://www.amazon.com/West-Bend-82306-Discontinued-Manufacturer/dp/B00004RC6R

I bought a bag of raw green arabica beans and then tried roasting half a pound. I've seen directions that say it should only take like 10 minutes or even less, but after 10 minutes they didn't look dark enough -- and they weren't crunchy enough. But it seems like the machine gets plenty hot -- I tried cooking popcorn in it and it finished popcorn in like 1 or 2 minutes.

After leaving the beans in the machine for more than 30 minutes, they eventually turned pretty dark. Then I tried grinding and making coffee with them in french press, with near boiling water, and plenty of coffee (about 60 ml per liter of water). And after waiting close to 10 minutes, it was just very weak coffee.

Any idea why the coffee would come out weak like this?

Is it ever true that some types of beans just produce weak coffee?

Will I have more luck with using a lot more coffee?

Should I roast these a different way?

If you ask me, this is bloody great news. It's been almost five years that the winning recipes follow exactly the same (unrealistic) pattern of 30-35 g of coffee brewed with a small amount of water around 85º C with by-pass water at a lower temperature up to 200 ml. I've tried this recipe a few times and it's shocking but tiring. Besides, it just makes me question the judges' approach to the whole championship. There's no encouragement of creativity, just copycatting the usual approach sends you to the top (or then you do like in 2017 and use 34.9 g of coffee which plainly screams 'Emperor's new dress'). 

Anyway, I hope we see a bit of innovation or weirdness in the Aeropress department from now on. I get that most championship recipes will not be daily drinkers and that reinventing the wheel is pretty difficult, but still, it was high time to shake things a little bit.

Coffee," I recently got hold of a medium roast arabica ground coffee (please spare me, I can't afford a grinder) from a premium coffee roaster, which claims its notes to be citrusy and mildly fruity.

I have always made my super-market arabica coffee in my South Indian Filter (Indian version of the Vietnamese Phin) and I have learned to make my perfect cup by tweaking the temperature of the water, the amount of coffee, and the pressure with which I pack it. My best method gives a cup that is a little too bitter for my taste, but a sprinkle of country sugar always makes it good.

Now, the arrival of this premium coffee (ground for the South Indian Filter) posed other problems.

It was not bitter, but it was TOO acidic. My palate is not trained to identify notes, thus I cannot get past this point. I tried saving it with my country sugar trick. Although it was drinkable, it was still noticeably a little too acidic to be pleasant. It smelled heavenly though.

How do I go about bringing the best out of such coffee? (with limitations listed at the end) Do I increase/decrease the water temperature? Do I pack in more/less coffee? Do I give more/less pressure packing it in?

This is the only coffee equipment I have. I don't have a grinder, scale, thermometer, and can only access one trustable source of drinking water.

Coffee,"Recently, I came across a blog post of Fellow's website about comparing cupping and pour over side by side and decided to give it a try. It was a more interesting comparison than I expected. For the cupping I used 9g of coffee to 150g of water steeped for 4 minutes because that's how much my cupping bowls hold. For pour over, I used the Stagg \[X\] with [my technique](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/mvv29e/my_favorite_stagg_x_technique/) that I've been using for about a few months. The coffee I used Heart's [K](https://www.heartroasters.com/products/kenya-nyawira-aa)enya Nyawira AA, which is excellent, despite being more tropical and floral than the classic aggressive Kenya flavor profile. I used Seattle tap water, remineralized to match the [Rao water recipe from Baristahustle](https://www.baristahustle.com/blog/diy-water-recipes-redux/). One relevant note is that I ground the coffee for the cupping one full rotation finer on my Kinu m47 phoenix that I did for pour over.

In the cupping, the coffee was sweet, pleasantly acidic, and had great clarity, but was maybe a touch on the mild side. It was pretty much what I would expect from this coffee in any full-immersion brew. The pour over tasted like every aspect of the coffee had been turned up to 11 compared to the cupping. It was far sweeter, more acidic (in a good way), and the flavors were so much more obvious - to the point where it almost felt like biting into a mango. I don't have a refractometer, but I'm quite confident that the pour over had a not insignificantly higher extraction. That's both because of the more intense (and in my opinion better) flavor, and the fact that the pour over had more texture/fuller body, despite being filtered through the pretty thick v60 boxed flavors.

This experiment has pretty solidly cemented my preference for percolation brewing, both because of intensity and balance of flavors. To be clear, I'm not dissing immersion brewing. I love siphons, french presses, and aeropresses, but it seems to me that you can hit higher highs with percolation brewing, at the cost of some finnickiness.

Coffee,"TL;DR: Yes it does.

REASONS FOR THIS EXPERIMENT: Ever since getting into the intricacies of coffee, one topic has been frustrating me: travel mugs. I typically brew my coffee in the morning, pour it in a travel mug, and only start drinking it once I arrive to work; however, I noticed that my coffee tasted different than the coffee I brewed during the weekends, which was straight from the brewer to a glass mug.  As I experimented and eventually surmised that ceramic and glass were the two materials that didn’t impact the taste of my coffee, I focused on another material that existed in nearly all leak-proof travel mugs: silicone. While I was very sure that coffee scents lingered on the silicone, I wanted to see if it was alter the taste of my coffee. 

EXPERIMENT: To do this, I set up a blind experiment with three mugs: Fellow Carter, Kyocera Travel Mug, and KeepCup. The Fellow and Kyocera were travel mugs that had silicone gaskets to prevent the coffee from spilling out of the vessel; both travel mugs were lined with a ceramic lining as well. The KeepCup had a leakproof lid (there is a silicone band in the lid, but it sits OUTSIDE the mug, never being in contact with the coffee), and was made out of glass. I wanted to do a blind test to see whether I could detect any differences in smell and taste when it came to those travel mugs; in particular, I wanted to see if the silicone in the two travel mugs changed the taste of the coffee. 

PREPARATION: I brewed a large cup of coffee into a glass carafe, and asked my girlfriend to pour them into the three vessels, but to leave some coffee in the glass carafe as the control variable. To keep things fair, I made sure the coffee had cooled down to a temperature where the thermal properties of the travel mugs wouldn’t make the glass KeepCup easy to identify. From there, I asked her to shake up the coffee in the travel mugs so that there would be exposure between the silicone and the coffee, and to pour the coffee from all three vessels into identical cupping bowls, labeled A, B, and C. I then proceeded to smell and taste the carafe, and then each bowl, and ultimately selected what vessel I thought each cupping bowl had come from.

RESULTS: When I started smelling the coffee, I noticed that Cup B had a much stronger, harsher scent than the other two bowls. When it came to taste, it felt like the strongest in flavor as well, almost to a point that it was bitter. Cup A and B were light in scent, and a bit sour. With that being said, the coffee in cup B tasted the smelled the most similar to the coffee in the glass carafe. Ultimately the results were:

Cup A: Kyocera Travel Mug

Cup B: KeepCup

Cup C: Fellow Carter

CONCLUSIONS: I had gotten Cup A and C wrong, but Cup B was correct. Both Cup A and C had similar lightness in scent, and sourness in taste; however, it did not taste similar to the coffee in the glass carafe. I can conclude that silicone changes the flavor of the coffee. While Cup B was the most unenjoyable cup out of the three, it was the most similar to the glass carafe, leading me to believe that it was just a case of user error when it came the taste of the coffee. That being said, the taste of the coffee in the travel mugs were not horrendous; however, if you are purchasing expensive coffee and want to experience the flavors that the roasters are intending, I would steer clear of travel mugs that have silicone in them. 

PERSONAL NOTES: I wish I had tested this with three ceramic mugs; however, I didn’t have any, and based off previous experiences, I figured that ceramic and glass didn’t impart flavors into my coffee the way stainless steel did. Because of this, I figured it would be enough to really isolate the silicone to determine if it changed the tastes of coffee. I am by no means any scientist, and I am sure that there are many inconsistences/ changes that I could have made to my experiment to make it more accurate, but I just wanted to point out my observations that I made to the best of my ability.

Coffee,"I find that I usually can a make pretty enjoyable coffee whenever I get beans from Latin American origins broadly(Brazil, Peru, and Central American usually). However I find I struggle to get a good taste from African Beans, and usually find my pours taking a lot longer (sometimes well over 3 minutes). I am not sure if this is common or if the divide isn't because of the origin per se, but some other factors about the beans (or if is all a just by chance occurrence).

Coffee,"Many popular supermarket coffee brands - Maxwell House, Folgers, Chock Full O' Nuts, Eight O'clock etc. - date back to pre-WW2 or even pre-WW1. When you see old magazine ads for those brands they are advertised as premium, better than average coffee. Of course right now they are, relatively speaking, bottom-shelf. Most people who drink them do so either from life-long habit or because they are cheap, not because they think they are better coffee.

Now is it just public taste and perception that changed (like how people used to like jello salads and now mostly find them disgusting) - or did these brands actually get worse by using inferior coffee (the way Craftsman tools' quality degraded over the years)? In other words, if I drink Maxwell House now - is it how good coffee was supposed to taste 100 years ago - or did it really use to be better?

Coffee," 

So down in my area, there's a place that serves this iced coffee drink that is extremely popular. It is called the Chippi from Mirasol's Cafe in Dartmouth, MA. The founder says the recipe is a secret and people call it ""dessert in a cup"" and it tastes like ""melted coffee ice cream."" It is the best coffee drink I have ever had and want to recreate it. From all the interviews he has given over the years, here's the clues I have gotten:

* It’s premixed with dairy and sweetener (they pour it from HOOD whole milk containers when you order one, so you know that's the dairy portion)
* He says he batch-makes it over a 2 day process.
* He says it has about four to six times as much caffeine as a regular coffee in the same size.
* He prepares most of the CHiPPi himself, but the kitchen staff often helps him out during the final process. But the recipe, is still largely a mystery to his staff. ""I pretty much just give them a puzzle and tell them to put it together.""

So I went and bought some of Dave's Cold Brew Coffee concentrate original syrup, and tried mixing with milk, but it was not quite the same, nor in color and held a syrup like taste.

Now, some speculate that the Chippi is simply coffee milk, which is a popular drink in RI. I had a friend that worked at this cafe once years ago, and she said one of the ingredients was coffee syrup to which I think may be the final step that the owner has his staff do, mix the syrup with the milk?

Now, there's a knock off coffee shop a few towns over that people compare this drink to that they make. They describe the process they make there's as: ""Created over a 2 ½ day process, one taste of The Mojo and you’ll understand why everyone in Fall River, MA, has fallen in love with our little concoction. Our signature drink is created using a unique process and finished with organic sugar and all-natural milk from a local dairy farm, and then the Mojo is ready to knock your socks off!""

So, I ask of the coffee experts here, what kind of coffee drink process would be infused with sugar, takes 2 days to make, have 4 to 6 times the caffeine, and they do not shake it when they pour the pre-made mix, meaning nothing settles?

Coffee,"I've been using a moka pot for about 3 years now, but really got into grinding fresh beans and trying speciality coffee about a year ago. Something I picked up on the way that I haven't seen mentioned much: the moka pot is very versatile in the sense of what you can do with the coffee it brews. 

It's perfectly suitable for all milk based drinks, be it a latte, cappuccino or even a frappe at that. Feel like an americano? Just add hot water. Iced americanos are my go to all summer. It can basically be used as a faux espresso for all espresso drinks. If you want a clearer cup of coffee just add an aeropress filter in the brew chamber.

One worry that I had what the moka proved me wrong on: that I won't be able to taste the different notes that the roaster mentions. The moka pot coffee in my opinion really highlights the notes of the coffees and I've been enjoying ordering a different coffee each time to see what it's going to taste like.

Coffee,"Hi guys! 

Just wanted to chime in on the customer service for Philips. We bought their top of the line [3200 series](https://www.amazon.com/Philips-Automatic-Espresso-Machine-Frother/dp/B07VDVDHZ9/ref=asc_df_B07VDVDHZ9/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=385266311735&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=15840612454238545168&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9032817&amp;hvtargid=pla-825155464990&amp;psc=1&amp;tag=&amp;ref=&amp;adgrpid=81511525194&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvadid=385266311735&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=15840612454238545168&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9032817&amp;hvtargid=pla-825155464990) off of Amazon which out of the box came with problems. We only got to brew one cup before it broke. After dealing with Amazon and then contacting them directly, it was determined that we should return it to Philips for a replacement. We spoke to them via Twitter and then transitioned to direct phone calls. The calls weren't precisely nice, their social media team is better at having a conversation. Through the calls, they sounded annoyed that the machine was under the 30day warranty, at the description of the problem, etc. We were aware that the machine is very sought after, and that it is pretty sold out everywhere, so we knew that it may be a thing to replace it, but I mean, what else would be a resolution to a faulty machine that's literally brand new?

We sent them the machine back right away. Now it's been almost a month and we still haven't been sent a new one, even when they admitted that we were under the warranty and that would be the expected resolution after speaking with several supervisors. When we contacted them again to have some kind of a time line, since they didn't even acknowledge that they had received the equipment, they were extremely rude, annoyed that we even asked. They were bothered that we wanted to know just how much time it would take, or that we expected any kind of further communication, and it seems pretty unsavory considering that the machine when bought was almost $1k.

On top of that - not that they're responsible for it, we had bought a variety of beans that are just sitting waiting to be used, and this part is also a let down since the more time it passes the less fresh they'll be, making this whole experience just a mess. 

Our objective was to stop using Nespresso Vertuo since per our calculations to switch to beans in the mid-long run it would be much cheaper and environmentally friendlier, and now we just had to put in another order of pods because we have no clue when Philips will resolve it. Have I mentioned that this was a b-day present that my sis hasn't been able to even enjoy??

Coffee,"I’ve been using a Delonghi Dedica for just over a year now. It’s my first coffee machine and I’ve slowly learned to get decent shots from it.  Even more so now I switched to a non-pressure basket and upgraded the grinder to a jx-pro.

Coffee,"Or do I really?? Seems I don't know what I'm talking about and have probably missed out on a lot of great coffee because of my ignorance. 

My favorite coffee ever is Brazil Fazenda Rio Verde Ipanema Grand Cru Apricot, that I got from Hasbean last year. https://archive.hasbean.co.uk/brazil-ipanema-aura-matina-premier-cru-b05-apricot-2020__13082  I brewed it using my beginner grinder and the Cup One MoccaMaster without much skill at all. But it's the only coffee I've ever truly loved; it tasted like pure coffee fruit juice and was incredible. (better to me than expensive rare or Gesha coffees I've since brewed) 

I found out today the above coffee is a Natural. I bought it last year before I developed a preconceived notion that I don't like naturally processed coffee. 

I've cut way down on adding sugar to my coffee (with a goal to stop adding at all), so am looking forward to coffee with super sweet and fruity tastes.  So..... for those of you who enjoy Naturals and those amazing fruit flavors, how do I buy ones I'll enjoy? I want fruity but not fermenty at all. (that fermenty, funky taste kills me) I think Black &amp; White and Sweet Bloom may be a good start?

Coffee,"Note, some of these points have my own opinions in them, I have written those in (brackets).


1. Normal/Inverted - Any, normal preferred.

2. Preheat - No, not necessary.

3. Rinse Filter - No, not necessary. (But I would recommend it, for sanitary reasons, also it is necessary if you are using the inverted method).

4. Reuse Filter - Yes, (I would not recommend over 3 reuses and the paper gets harder with sediments over time).

5. Double Filter - No, as there isn’t noticeable effects if you press gently.

6. Roast - any, but grind size and brew-time changes accordingly.

7. GrindSize - Fine.

8. Ratio - 12g to 200g, (11g to 200g for darker roasts).

9. Water Temp - 80 Cor 100 C, prefer 100. ( could go with 90s for darker roasts but IMO 100 Celsius works really well for all roasts).

10. Bloom - no, not necessary.

11. Stirring - Swirl before press. (Necessary for coarser brews).

12. Settle Bed - yes, 30s before press. 

13. Brew-time - 120s / 240s / 480s - directly proportional to grind size. The longer steep the better. 

14. Press - press gently.

15. Hiss - press through it, will yield a little more coffee.

**Attachments. **

Only one that’s worth was the Fellow Prismo, especially since you get a free metal filter with it. 


**Alternative Filtration. **

Metal, Cloth, Paper and Premium Paper, all are good and give different results.

1. Metal - Will give you a more FrenchPress like cup, with better Texture and Body, but will also have more Muddiness to it. (Recommend using a Medium or Medium Fine for it).

2. Premium Paper - Will give you a PourOver like cup with more Clarity but low Texture.

3. Paper - which is the default AeroPress filter, little bit of texture and body along with some clarity.

4. Cloth - it’s the middle ground between Paper and Metal.

Coffee,"What’s the point when you can filter an immersion brew to improve clarity (ie clever coffee, or a French press poured through a paper filter)? Watching Hoffman’s videos and running some tests at home, immersion brewing is incredibly forgiving of grind size and grind consistency, essentially netting you a very even extraction on immersion. If you then use a clever coffee dripper, or pour the resultant French press through a paper filter, you can remove suspended particles and get a very clean cup.

Other than the fun and challenge of the pour over ritual, this seems to be from what I’m finding a much more consistent and forgiving way to get the same results as a attempting to dial in a v60/Kalita/Chemex to perfect where you run the risk of channeling, inconsistent grind size, choking, bad technique, etc.

Coffee,"I seem to have this 'problem' where I can't taste the sweetness and aroma from my coffee on its own.

Recently, I made a few cups of coffee using the same beans, same method with progressively coarser grind settings just to fine tune the grind size. The first sip tastes ok - nothing spectacular, balanced tasting cup. Tastes and smells like regular coffee. When I tasted and compared it to the other cups, suddenly the same first cup had much more sweetness, more berry aroma and notes of peach. Very pleasant. By the time I finished the brews, all of them have cooled to room temperature, so I don't think it was a temperature issue. The perceived sweetness only became apparent after I compared the cups.

&amp;#x200B;

The next day, I used the fine tuned grind size and brewed a cup with the same method. It tasted very meh, which made me wonder: Is it a thing that everyone experiences where you will only be able to appreciate its sweetness when there is something else to taste and compare to or is there a 'magical' grind setting where the sweetness becomes dominant even when tasting on its own?

Grounds in bowl (Always measured in grams)

Pour 195-205F degree water at a 1-16.5 ratio

Allow to brew for 4 min.

Break the crust with spoon and stir 4 times

Give the coffee a min to settle and use 2 spoons to scoop the top layer of floating grounds and discard in a water cup.

Allow the coffee to cool to drinkable temp (140F-ish)

Coffee,"I’m perplexed. I have a bag of Proud Mary beans that are absolutely delicious, and I made a perfect pour over yesterday. But this morning, the beans smelled awful. Grinding them made the scent even worse. And the end result was undrinkable.

They smell and taste of vinegar and must (old, wet basement smell). What could have caused this? The beans are not that old, maybe 9 days off roast. I’ve kept them sealed. I can’t understand the problem, and I especially can’t understand why they turned so quickly. 

By the way, this is not the first time I’ve tasted this off flavor before. A few months ago, with a bag from a completely different roaster, I experienced that vinegar/must aroma/flavor, and I had to toss the bag. So maybe this has happened to others, if it’s happened to me, twice. Does anyone have an explanation for this?

Coffee,"Hello all, just wondering if it is truly possible to expect a bag of beans, roasted in a way that works well for both espresso and filter coffee?

For context, I drink mostly espresso, black. In the afternoons I like to take my time and make myself a pourover or aeropress. Unfortunately, the beans that tasted great and had strong body in my espresso taste muddy, heavy, without much sweetness or clarity in filter brews. I understand that lightly roasted coffees are the go-to for filter, but these don't taste that great in espresso conversely- overpowering acidity, and ultimately notes that I don't want in a long black.

Now, I'm wondering if it's actually possible for me to order a single bag of beans and expect it to pull double duty. Does anyone have any thoughts on this matter? Are medium roasts that claim to be great for espresso in all cases, just not going to do that well for filter and vice versa?

Coffee,"Got some fresh beans (heirloom cultivars) from Ethiopia which is a light roast from my roaster. 
Upon brewing with the V60, it was a good clear, cup with pleasant acidity and mild sweetness. But upon trying it with the aeropress, that sweetness I was getting was magnified which turned into one of the most awesome cups I made.

Coffee,"Hi there, I have an E65s I bought new through SCG in July 2020, but only put into service in October 2020.  In January I started having massive static issues, at the same time I noticed I had to start setting the grind a lot finer for the same beans/roast.  I cleaned and recalibrated everything multiple times with no change.  I figured it was due to the weather or something.  Now that it is warmer, the static has almost completely disappeared but I'm still setting the grind much finer than I am comfortable with.  Often we are grinding at 0.7 or 0.5 and this is a dark roast!

Coffee,"Literally just made a cup a few minutes ago, recipe is around 12oz of water to 4 tablespoons of medium grind coffee (I know, I know, will probably get a weighing scale soon xD)

I let it brew for 4 minutes, and after that, just as an experiment, I plunged down as fast as I could. This does not change a weird trend I've been seeing in all my FP cups lately- there doesn't seem to be any fines/grounds at the bottom of the cup!

I know that generally, this is actually quite the good thing- cleaner, sludge free cups are preferred by many, and an entire alternate FP technique is known for making cups like that as well. (The Hoffmann/no plunge recipe)

But the reason that I'n puzzled is that I'm just following a basic French Press recipe, one that should usually result in a fair amount of fines/grounds at the bottom of the cup. I'm not saying that I actually LOVE the fines, but I'm thinking that if my FP brews come out unusual like this, other parts of the cup might have also been affected as well (maybe the oils from the coffee, sweetness/strength, etc.)

I should mention that I actually have 3 French Press's at home, (thank you mom! xD) and the one that I used today actually has two mesh screens attached to the plunger, instead of the other two that I have, which only have one mesh screen each. This could be the possible answer to why, but I also do remember also not getting any fines/grounds from one of the 1-mesh FP's as well. Huh.

Coffee,"I have a Breville 870 XL, which is now the Barista Express model. I use that for making espresso drinks, but I also make aeropress, mocha and occasionally pour overs. When I make these other styles I use the built in grinder on the Breville to grind the beans. 
 
Am I missing out on not having a separate grinder for these other coffee styles? The Breville grinder has adjustments but they are very incremental, so I suspect I’m just getting variations of espresso grinds no matter the grind size setting. This could explain why my pour overs aren’t very good, but I’ve not put much time into mastering that method. (I usually use the aeropress when I want a long coffee.)

Coffee,"Hey there

I have a gaggia new classic (the black one). It seems no matter what I do the shots are always over sour.

As a grinder I use the niche zero (have this for over a year now, seems to be a good grinder). I try to grind as fine as I can without choking the machine.

Parameter I played around with: Grind size, water temp (?), extraction (more water or less coffe). Lets say I go for 32g extraction and use 16g coffe in 25seconds, its too sour. Same parameters except 14g coffee and its still sour but also slightly bitter.

I got channeling a couple of times but even then it was too sour...

Last time I was trying for approx 1h to make a decent shot so I would assume the machine was decently hot. If I flush before extraction and wait for the lamp to come back on or if I just let the machine sit for a couple of minutes more does not seem to make a difference.

I start to wonder if the water is just not hot enough in general even if it sits there for a long time. I notice that little light that indicates if the machine is ready goes on and off some times even if the machine was on for a long time.

I tried to dial in different coffees to also exclude the coffee as a problem. I am a bit lost to be honest. Can someone help? Thanks!

\----

Edit: Thanks all for replying. Got some additional stuff to try out and thought I will write it down here. might give other people with similar issues some ideas:

* Use different water. Will try unfiltered water first and then bottled water.
* pressure issue with the machine? Might go for an OPV mod, not sure yet.
* Beans too fresh too old? Dont think this is my case here.
* Knocking the portafilter around before inserting it into the machine. I dont do this but who knows.

\----

Edit2: Still no progress. Tried different water to no effect. Went to the store and bought some generic espresso blend to try a different coffee again. still all shots are on the sour end. I can not grind finer or extract longer without getting other unwanted flavours or clogging the machine. My wife does not like the shots as well and thinks they are sour.

Will do the OPV mod once it arrives but cant imagine this helping with the issue. After this I am out of ideas honestly. I cant believe that I did not get one lucky shot at least out of all the things I tried... sadly they were all undrinkable and if it stays this way I think I will sell the machine.

\----

Edit3: Got a thermometer and measured 82 degree Celsius holding it directly into the water stream. 80 degree C from the preheated cup. I know this is a highly inaccurate way to measure. I will try to get a different cup to see if I can get readings closer to 90 degree. I dont need to know exactly how hot the water is I just want to know if I should claim warranty. At the moment it seems to me that the water is never hot enough to brew espresso.

\----

Edit4: I figured out some other methods to measure temp and it seems to be alright. I measured 91.5 C in the empty portafilter. If I want it a bit warmer depending on the coffee I turn on the steam button for a couple of seconds. What I noticed is that I never really need to flush before making an espresso. There is no steam buildup (unless I use the steam button). Since this is a machine from the newest batch they might have changed something on the behaviour... I don't know.

Now to the important part: The OPV mod seems to help indeed. I got it today and the espresso was much more enjoyable right away. I will try with other beans again to be certain. But it is not as lemony as before and also does not leave an unpleasant taste in the mouth after drinking the coffee. In my mind I cannot imagine what the pressure has to do with sourness but it is a really big difference... Thank you all for your inputs!

Coffee,"So for the past \~2 weeks my brews were all bitter and kinda flavorless. I thought it might be something wrong with my process, grind size, ratios and ultimately my cheap fake-burr DeLonghi KG79 grinder, so I started looking for a better grinder (ordered a Comandante, hope it'll arrive soon).  
Anyway, I was not satisfied with waiting drinking close-to-horrible coffee until then, so I thought... hmm, maybe it's time to clean it.  


So I took the ^(fake) burr out and whaddya know, the whole place was filled with very fine coffee dust (it did smell great but but that's the only positive) so I brushed it off as good as I could with a fine toothbrush and today I brewed another one and guess what? IT WAS FINALLY A DECENT BREW, with flavor notes (although *maybe* I'm finally starting to understand how inconsistent grinding affects the taste). In any case, it's enjoyable and I can happily wait for the new one.  


**TL;DR:** If your brews started being consistently bad, although there was a time when you got them right almost every time, it might be time to clean your grinder (especially if it's a fake-burr, probably, since these make even more powder grinds). It might require special care when taking it apart/putting it back together, depending on model, but in my case it fixed my problem.

Coffee,"Looking for advice on what my next coffee brewer should be. Most mornings I like to drink about 3 cups of coffee over a couple hours. Typically black or with a dash of milk.

My daily driver for the last two years has been a **Bonavita** drip machine (with the thermal carafe) and a **Capresso Infinity** grinder. Recently the Bonavita has been making really weak coffee and after ripping it apart I found the showerhead mechanism keeps separating and leaking hot water out of the side. Fixed it once but it broke again.

Like all good coffee drinkers, I have several other brewing methods at my disposal:

* Electric Moka pot &gt; really like this for lattes but not for when I want a few cups of coffee
* Aeropress &gt; a good clean cup but too much hassle when I want three cups in the morning
* Bodum French press &gt; makes bold coffee but way too much sediment and grit and cools down quickly
* Hario V60 &gt; decent single cup of coffee but I don't have a gooseneck kettle and don't want to make three individual cups
* Cheap Chemex knockoff from Target with mesh filter &gt; typically makes weak coffee with too much sediment
* I bought a Chemex two years ago and it fell off my counter and shattered immediately after I washed it the first time...didn't even get to use it
* I've got an electric variable temp kettle but it's not a gooseneck, FYI

After looking at espresso machines and different replacement drip machines, I'm thinking I may just keep with a simpler manual process for now. I've got three options I'm looking at:

1. **Espro P6 (or P7) French press** \&gt; in theory this would give me a cleaner cup than a traditional French press and with no filters to purchase. Double wall steel is durable and would hold temp well. Seems to get good reviews but not a lot of people use them?

Coffee,"I was about to make my morning cup. Turning the crank on the grinder was really hard and made a terrible noise. I took everything apart, to find the bearing in my Timemore C2 grinder had seized. For a second, I thought about spraying WD-40 in there, but wisely elected for a drop of vegetable oil instead. It brought it back to life. But for how long?

Is it possible to change the bearing in this grinder? It seems glued in place. Failing that, I think it may be time to upgrade to a 1zpresso...

Coffee,"Hello all,

I’m looking to buy my father in law a coffee bean roaster. The last few months he’s been getting into roasting his own coffee and has been using a popcorn maker which works for him but it can only be done in smaller batches of a few ounces at a time. 

So, I wanted expert advice on what a good coffee roaster would be for around $400 or so that has a larger capacity maybe closer to 16 ounces or so. I don’t have any experience with roasting my own coffee beans so I’m taking a shot in the dark with this and hope you all can help guide me in the right direction.

Coffee,"So during the pandemic, like many others I’ve been going down the rabbit hole of coffee brewing. I’d been making auto drip on a Bonavita Connoisseur with pre-ground coffee, with the occasional Nespresso + frothed milk for a homemade cappuccino.  About a year ago I wanted to improve my home brewing, so I got a Timemore C2, a Hario V60, and scale (we already owned an Oxo gooseneck electric kettle). I bought local specialty beans and watched James Hoffman videos and now can make what I consider a pretty good pour over. 

The issue now is I still miss having that large pot of coffee to drink all day while I’m working from home, but now the pregound grocery store coffee tastes stale and I can’t stand grinding for 40-50 g with the Timemore. So I want to get a Baratza Encore or Virtuoso so I can grind large batches for the bonavita. But my wife says there’s not enough counter space for the Nespresso Creatista, the Bonavita, the kettle and an electric grinder. She’s fine with the v60 and C2 because they get stored in a cabinet. I dunno what to do. Is it worth it to get the Encore but move it in and out of a cabinet everytime I want to use it?  And I can’t ditch the Nespresso Creatista machine because we both like having the auto milk frothing arm. Any advice?

Coffee,"Hello everyone,

Like a lot of you guys I was very excited when James aeropress video came out. Prior to that I was using a 1:12 ratio of medium roast coffee ground coarser than aeropress (1 rotation, number 2) on my JX Pro with inverted method, letting it brew for 1:30  before pressing to until 2:30. With a 200 degree water temp. With this setup I got some coffee I really liked and some that was just okay. 

&amp;#x200B;

I’ve tried his recipe every day since the video was released and I’m having a really difficult time brewing a good cup of coffee that isn’t weak tasting and sour. I’ve grounded both finer and coarser than my original grind setting on the JX Pro. I’ve also dropped the temperature like he recommended. But every time the coffee doesn’t taste good to me. Even when I ground a lot finer and was getting close to espresso range ( I also have an espresso machine) it still tasted weak and watery.

I understand that some people would simply tell me to brew however I like. Yet I trust Hoffman’s process, so it’s bothering me that his evidence based approach to aero press is not working for me. I like my coffee a bit on the stronger side, but can totally drink a drip coffee from a commercial chain and be satisfied. So I don’t think it’s a case where my taste deviates vastly from the majority. 

Anyone troubleshooting suggestions? Or did anyone else get bad results that they fixed? I’ve been really into coffee for over a year so I’m definitely not an expert but I’d like to think I have a basic understanding of brewing.

Coffee,"Hi all,

My setup is a SGP grinder and a DeLonghi Dedica. When I started using this grinder I was using a light/medium roast and set my grind setting to the finest. I put in 20g, got 50ml out in 26 seconds. Now I finished the bag and wanted to try something more intense, so I went with an extra dark roasted coffee. However when I grind these on the finest setting, it nearly chokes my machine. It takes ages to drip even 20 ml out.

Coffee,"I did all of the right things to make espresso at home. I bought myself a good espresso machine. I learned which espresso beans have the best taste and how to grind them to the correct fineness. I managed to insert the gadget with the grinds, known as a portafilter, into the espresso machine, lock it into place, turn on the machine and let her rip. Great espresso! 

But I wanted a cappuccino. Sue wanted a latte. Time to figure out how to steam the milk. 

Sue is always dieting, so she wants nonfat milk. I found out that low fat and nonfat milk foam really easily. Whole milk takes more practice. Same thing with half and half if you want a breve.

Some espresso machines have a built in steam nozzle and some don’t. You may need to buy a separate steamer. I recommend getting an espresso machine with one built in. Saves space. 

The first thing to do is to put that stainless steel pitcher and milk into the refrigerator to get cold. Always start with them cold. And then my next learning curve came with remembering to fill the pitcher about a third to a half full. Milk expands really well when it’s steamed. It takes only once for it to foam up, overflow and hit the floor to remember to start with a pitcher no more than half full.

Start by putting the nozzle on the surface of the milk and turning the steam on full. The milk is going to begin to foam, so keep lowering the pitcher so that the nozzle is just under the surface of the milk. About a half inch will do fine. You can turn down the pressure when the foam really begins to rise, or just take the pitcher away. Now the milk is just about at the boiling point.

Now here is something important. Don’t let it boil. This is another way to get the milk to overflow the pitcher. Or even worse, it will taste burnt. Ugh. Nasty. 

Your steamed milk should have little bubbles all the way through it, and there should be a light foam on the top. There you are. That’s it. Now you go make whatever espresso drink you want. Next up, you can start learning how to make all those fancy designs in the top.

As for the current state of affairs, the red switch does work, but takes about 20-30 minutes to heat up. I have managed to get something approaching coffee (maybe espresso?) out of it as it does eventually boil.

When I flip the white switch, it does not heat up at all, and if the red switch was on, it will turn off entirely. I think the switches actually work OK, and the wires seem to be in good condition.

I've descaled and cleaned out the boiler as much as a I can, and pushing water through the group comes out clean.

I'm guessing the corrosion around the electrical contacts is problematic, as well as the odd white bit on the heating element. If I could replace this part, I think I'd be good to go, but I haven't been able to track down a vendor.

Is this a lost cause? Any advice or suggestions would be appreciated!

Coffee,"* **Does boiling water too often negatively impact the taste of the coffee?**
* **How long does it take for water to re-oxygenate?**

I've heard that when you boil water, it loses its oxygen and that makes the coffee taste bad if you do it too much with the same water. Trouble is, the water where I live is very hard and doesn't make good tasting coffee, so I need to use bottled. However, if I only boil a small amount then its temperature quickly becomes too cool to brew with.

Coffee,"Using light roasted Ethiopian Yirgacheffe beans that smell absolutely delicious - chocolatey, slightly fruity, almost creamy - though every time I’ve tried to brew with them I get metallic, oily water.

So far I have tried the finest, coarsest, and middle setting on my grinder which have produced a fine powder, gravel and your standard ground coffee respectively. I’ve been brewing with a Chemex (1 to 14 ratio) side by side with a French press (1 to 17 ratio) all morning with each grind setting, and I’ve got through half my bag so far. 

Each time it’s produced the same deathly frail, flavourless, bodiless coffee. It’s oily, it hangs at the back of your throat like thin phlegm, and tastes like boiled coins.

I’m by no means a pro with pourovers, so it could be my technique, but this whole thing began with a 50g to 700ml ratio of a medium-coarse grind and highland spring water (which I’ve been using this whole time). However, when you compare the brew of atomised coffee beans in a French press, and a Chemex brew with a 6.5 minute drawdown, and they both taste thin, underextracted, and THE SAME, then I suppose you’ve got to look at the common factor.

What could it be? Please help me not commit any more crimes against coffee!

Coffee,"I just saw their post &amp; video recipe for V60 and the water temp is ""80-95°C (rises with the number of days since the coffee was roasted)""

* in the post they're using: 18g to 240ml of water (1:13.333)
* in the video: 16g to 220ml of water (1:13.75)

Theoretically, the post quantity is what they use in the shops and while it's not my favorite V60, it's pretty good, not bitter, doesn't taste too concentrated.  


I'm still new at brewing and still have a way to go until I get consistently good brews, but in most recipes I see ratios of 1:15-1:18. And also never seen a temperature below 90°C. How come?   


What's your go-to, tried and tested ratio? 

I've been trying 1:15-1:16 but I still get bitter, flavorless brews often (this time I tried adding some water to it and it made it better, but definitely didn't have the \*right\* aroma still, I only managed to do 1 good brew out of 4-5 with this coffee yet).

Coffee,"Hey All,

I can make a very repeatable cup, but I often wonder if I'm getting the best of of my beans. I'm running a v60, with a nice manual grinder (Timemore G2), and pretty good beans (Sweet Bloom, Anchorhead, Camber, Heart, etc) basically doing a 4:6 or Hoffman style brew. 

I typically play around with grind size (somewhere between 10 and 14 on the G2) and brew techinque. I know I can make things worse, and sometimes I definitely hit a home run. But I don't feel like I'm batting 1000 yet, and my 'dial in' process is pretty much trial and error. 

What do y'all do to dial in a new bag of beans? What variables do you play with besides grinds and technique?

Coffee,"I bought a Kinu M47 Simplicity about a year ago. When I got it I checked the true zero and it was at the 0.0.2 mark. This week after pulling some espresso shots I noticed I kept clogging the basket which was weird and unexpected so I decided to zero the grinder. This time I noticed the true zero is now at the 0.2.4 mark. This is a drastic change in true zero and I have absolutely not idea why this happened. For reference I switch between the pour over burr every now and then and when I do I always make sure to zero the grinder before selecting my setting, and that 0.0.2 mark is always where it lands until today.

I also do not have a goose neck kettle yet, so I am using a measuring cup I got from Ikea, I am not worrying about the water temperature as as the grounds' packaging recommends 85 degrees Celsius which I am getting.

I am usually brewing a cup at a time and the current grounds I am using are the Starbucks House blend, the prepacked grounds. 

The issue I am having is that at the blooming stage, once I start adding the water and after it wets all the grounds, it start to seep through the middle, leaving a hole in that place. This is something forcing me to start pouring water before the recommended 30 seconds pass.

I tried to google this up but I am not really getting a direct answer, or able to pin point what's going wrong. Any recommendations or advice are greatly appreciated. Thanks.

Coffee,"I've been french pressing for years and have my french press method down to an art form at this point (at least for my liking) and love it. But after finding out about the link with french press coffee and cholesterol recently (cafestol), I decided to change it up and get a clever dripper.

But... I'm completely lost on how to make a good cuppa with it. I've watched the James Hoffmann video on it, and have done it a few times now, tried a fine and a medium grind, wet the filter beforehand and drained, but in both cases my cup came out muddy and flat tasting, very single note, losing the flavor profile of the beans. 

These are good beans too, normally fruity and a bit chocolaty. I'm using beans from Happy Mug, Ethiopian Yrgacheffe and Peru Inca Valle currently. Also have one of my favorites, Ethiopian Guji on hand, but not willing to waste those beans on a bad brew.

I think what it comes down to is I know exactly how much bean to water to do for my french press, but I haven't gotten it right yet with the Clever. But I don't understand how the brew is turning out *so* bad with good beans. I'm doing a 4 minute brew, which is my normal for the french press as well. I'm at high altitude as well, so the water temperature for boiling is a bit lower, but I generally bring the water to boil, wait 15-20 seconds, and then pour in.

Coffee,"Need help and I am now in desperate phase.

We had to replaced our gas stove with induction hob, so my husband bought me this [Bialetti New Moka Induction](https://www.cremashop.eu/en/products/bialetti/moka-induction-red). 

The problem is if I put it on the higher heat it starts splurging coffee in small amounts all around the kitchen, and it needs a lot of time to fill the upper chamber and then this coffee is undrinkable.
If I put it on lower heat water stays in the chamber where the coffee is and needs a lot of time to get out. I guess there is not enough pressure to get it going out.

I tried with preheated water and cold water. 
I used different settings on hob lover and higher. Different rings on hob. Nothing worked. I just can not make the coffee to go out in nice consistent flow. I am not stranger of preparing moka because I was making pretty  good cup on gas burner.
Has anyone got some good recipe how to make moka on induction or there is something wrong with my moka or induction?

Coffee,"To preface, I received an Aeropress this past Christmas and was super excited to try it. It did the trick, and I made a lot of drinkable single cups with it. 

But I was convinced that it could be better, and so I began looking for brewing techniques. At this time James was still holding back on us so I was really just searching for the next best thing. 

I found Blue Bottle Coffee Co's brewing guide and thought ""wow, this is kinda complicated, that must mean it gives you the most control and the best cup of coffee!"" But of course it didn't, and I eventually set the Aeropress aside because I was spending too much time trying to brew a single cup that would disappoint me. 

And then James released his Aeropress series, and mine eyes were opened. I didn't need to invert, I didn't need to ""rinse out the flavor of the paper"", and I didn't need to push as fast as possible after waiting maybe 30 secs. All I needed was the right ratio, the right temperature, and about 3 minutes. 

So I started making coffee with the Aeropress again, starting with the standard 12:200 ratio and getting more ""OK"" cups. Mostly they were just small and since I was using Philz medium and dark roast coffee, the flavors that did pop out weren't the most mind-blowing. The one I had this morning was exactly that. 

This afternoon, however, I watched James' video on the Hario plastic kettle and got inspired to try using something similar instead of haphazardly pouring the water out of my electric kettle. I used Starbucks Komodo Dragon Blend, an herbal dark roast. I also upped the dosage, sticking to the 12:200 ratio but using 300 grams/milliliters of water instead which required 18 grams of coffee. I also went with a slightly lower temp, from 200°F or so down to 190. 

I followed all the instructions, poured with precision for the first time ever, and got a nice full cup of beautiful looking and smelling coffee. But my God I was not prepared for the taste. I rather timidly gave it a sip more to check temperature than anything else, and almost dropped my mug! I gave it a couple seconds and did a double take, and got the same outstanding sip!

Whether it's the different coffee beans or the Ultimate Aeropress Technique I don't yet know, but what I do know is that for the first time in recent memory, every sip of coffee is utterly fantastic. Zero acidity, full flavor, heavy, herbal, with some slight spice notes calling back to some of the best cigars I've smoked. Even as the coffee cooled down it retained all these qualities. Even the lingering finish makes me grin like an idiot! I'm super excited for tomorrow's cups :D

Coffee,"Hello!

Sorry if this post is nothing interesting but I just felt like sharing. I just upgraded from my Hario Skerton Pro to a Comandante grinder and I've set up a cupping similar to what James Hoffman did in his video. I did a blind testing comparing the taste and the difference is clear as day, even for someone like me who doesn't have a developed palete or anything like that.

Going for a better grinder effectively unlocks the taste of your beans! It's the best investment I have made and I would 100% recommend going for a good grinder off the bat!

Coffee,"So about a month ago I watched James Hoffman's channel, then watched Morgan Drinks Coffee and finally bought some gear. I got a coffee scale, a beautiful french press with a copper wrapping and li, a coffee storage container, and an FX-Pro grinder not due until the end of the month. My first batch of coffee was pre-ground but from a local farmer who grows his plants organically. I played a bit with grounds to water ratio making coffee in the French press. 

I have a friend that sees me as his father figure and spends a considerable amount of time here in my apartment. So naturally he was curious how it would be different. I had to wait a day and his response was that he woke up dreaming of the coffee. Me? It was a fantastic coffee even though it was not ground for the press. Mr. Coffee will never be coming back out again. Next month it is local coffee beans and self-grinding. There is a local shop that provides roasting date on the bags!

Coffee,"Over the past month or two, I've been tumbling down the coffee rabbit hole. More like skiing down the coffee mountain, really. I went from drinking shitty technique french press coffee prepared with a blade grinder to buying like $1,000ish worth of coffee and brewing equipment. Maybe ""toys"" is a better descriptor. 

I will have to wait a good month for the DF64 grinder to arrive, and I've been making pour overs and aeropress brews with a baratza encore. My Flair arrived this week, and I've anxiously been just sort of staring at it. Sort of intimidated, I've justified not using it yet by not having a proper grinder. 

Until today. 

I figured I'd just use my Encore and grind as finely as I am able and go from there. I've never brewed espresso before, so I know it's gonna be crap, but at least I'll get the first embarrassment out of the way. 

I ground 20g of Kicking Horse swiss water coffee (I'd already had a few today, and a man can only take so much caffeine). I preheated the Flair's portafilter and brew head, filled the brew head with water, tamped the coffee, got my cup and scale setup, started my timer, and...

Brewed the worst cup of anything I've ever tasted. I immediately spit it out, laughing at even being capable of making coffee this gross. It took me like two whole minutes to pull the 40g shot because my grind was so terrible (way too fine and inconsistent). My pressure was all over the place, too, swinging from 5 bars to 10. 

Meanwhile I'm also trying to learn some basic latte art. And I mean basic. Monk's head basic. First try last night I produced really great milk texture but couldn't do any design. Today I went to try again for my first espresso. The milk immediately turned into a damn bubble bath inside the pitcher. The whole thing was an absolute disaster and mess. To top it off, my espresso puck was just mud. 

And I couldn't be happier. I'm so excited to be starting at the absolute bottom of the barrel. I know there is a big learning curve. But I also know that within a few months I'll be brewing tasty espresso, hopefully with some degree of consistency, and especially when my grinder comes in. I'm really excited!

Coffee,"Hey all,

I'm having issues with my pour over setup recently. I had taken a break from using my chemex for a few months while the supply of filters seemed really low in my local area, but finally just caved and paid the high shipping to order filters directly from them.

Problem is now, though, that for some reason my brew is now taking upward of 7 minutes to fully draw! I'm using my baratza encore on the same setting I always used to get draw completion at around 3:30 (size ~21 on my grinder), and even after trying to go WAY more coarse it's still well over 6 minutes.

I clean my grinder regularly and made sure to do a fresh clean before testing with more coarse grinds, but I still get the slow draw. I usually clean it by taking the wire brush to all of the components that I can remove, and then taking my vacuum to it to suck out residual fines and pieces down where I can't reach. 

Here are some images of two brews from today with fairly coarse grinds, both resulted in a final draw at around the 7 minute mark give or take:

https://imgur.com/a/CgyfRJU

Now, obviously this is troublesome because going this coarse resulted in underextraction and ergo bad coffee. I follow James Hoffmans methods for the most part making minor adjustments depending on the bean, but no luck. 

What do I do here? Is there a better way to clean the encore that I'm not aware of? Should I contact baratza maybe? Or did I get a bad batch of filters?

Coffee,"Shopping for my new apartment and loving coffee, I thought it would be cool to upgrade to a goose neck kettle. Couldn't hurt... right?

I am a minimalist so I really don't want to own two kettles just to get a goose neck kettle is the thing. My question is, to the goose-neck-kettle-owners: Do you own two? Is there any draw back to just owning a goose neck kettle, like the pour speed being too slow when pouring for lets say tea?

Might be a silly question, I know. :)

I am looking to get the Stagg EKG specifically, it just speaks to me design wise. FYI.

edit: How is the operation if you just want boiling water on the Stagg? is it a press of the button? And are goosenecks any more susceptible to calcium? Need to be cleaned more regularly?

Coffee,"I have been using a Fellow Stagg \[X\] for a few weeks, and I've recently settled on a technique that I like. I've based it mostly off of Jonathan Gagne's new(ish) post on his blog, Coffee Ad Astra, with a few changes to match how I prefer to use the brewer. I thought I'd share it here in the hopes that a few people might learn something.

Here's all the equipment that I use:

* Fellow Stagg \[X\]
* Circle cut out of metal mesh
* Fellow Stagg \[X\] filters
* V60 02 filters
* Hario stovetop kettle
* Hario Scale
* Kinu M47 Phoenix
* Hario Range Server 02
* Tap water (I live in Seattle so tap water is fine)
* Chopstick (rarely necessary)

The super quick version is as follows (details and explanations later): 22g of coffee to 374g of water, ground at a typical pour over setting. Water is as hot as possible. Rinse the filter and preheat. 45 second long 74g bloom (makes the numbers nice), followed by 3 evenly sized circle pours (100g each), each taking 20 seconds with a 20 second pause in between pours. Swirl thoroughly during the bloom (stir with chopstick if there are any particularly stubborn clumps of dry coffee) and after the each pour. Final drawdown time usually lands at around 4:00 +/- 0:45, depending on the filters. 

On to the details and explanations. I'll try not to be too repetitive here. I started using the Stagg \[X\] after becoming frustrated with my v60 and reading the post on Coffee Ad Astra I mentioned earlier. I prefer it to the v60 because of the better heat retention and the shape, which seems to encourage more even extractions.  I like to use three pours because that strikes a good balance between the benefits of more pours and the benefits of higher slurry temperatures for this particular dose. Using more pours increases extraction by introducing clean water into the slurry throughout the brewing process. Watch Scott Rao and Jonathan Gagne's video on IGTV for more information on that. The larger than usual bloom is to make the numbers nice for later pours, allowing each post-bloom pour to be 100g. 

After my water boils, I take it off the heat, wait for it to stop bubbling so that it pours nicely (about 5 seconds), then pour at the highest possible flow rate that I can while maintaining a vertical stream of water. That 20 second timing from above is about that flow rate for my kettle. I also pour as high as I can without the water stream breaking up into droplets. This maximizes agitation which increases extraction and collapses channels. I always do circle pours because I've never had good results with center pours. The swirls collapse channels and even out the coffee bed. 22g is the lowest dose that I've had consistently good results with on this brewer. I have had some good results with 20g and 18g doses, but they are more finicky and harder to consistently replicate. 

A note on filters. I use v60 filters with my Stagg by taking a dry filter, smushing it to fit the brewer, and rinsing that when I preheat with water from the kettle. I use v60 filters by default because they drastically reduce bypass and are cheaper than the Fellow filters.  It's important to use a metal mesh below the filter to prevent clogging with the v60 filters because the filters can sag to clog the holes easily. I usually only use the Fellow filters when I'm using a coffee that's particularly vulnerable to clogging, usually Ethiopians or decaf.  I usually use the mesh screen even with the Fellow filters because there's no reason that I can see not to. 

Finally, remember that any coffee brewing method will only ever be a reflection of the coffee and water that you put in. Some of my favorite roasters whose coffee is consistently good are Elm Coffee Roasters in Seattle, George Howell Coffee in Boston, Heart Coffee in Portland, and Regalia Coffee in New York City. Always make sure to cup any coffee you buy first thing so that you go into the dialing-in process with an understanding of what you're working with. This method works well for me, but your results may vary. Feel free to ask any questions you might have; there are no stupid questions. I hope this was useful, and happy brewing.

Coffee,"I know this community to be one that respects accuracy (right down to the specific elevation of beans, the exact roasting date, the name of the producer / region) - so why do some specialty coffee roasters insist on calling the Gesha coffee variety as “Geisha”? 

1. Gesha refers to the specific region in Ethiopia, where the varietal came from.

2. “Geisha” refers to a traditional Japanese performer, which people have tended to associate with the exoticism of the East (associations that align to Gesha’s floral notes). This orientalist angle is problematic in an era where people are aiming to decolonize by empowering small scale coffee producers.

Since Hacienda La Esmerelda came out with the original Panamanian Gesha, there’s been a boom of relatively low priced Gesha’s grown in central/South America which is great because it has improved accessibility to this awesome bean. However, I’m wary about cheaper brands that use the “Geisha” label as it reeks of trend-pandering and makes me doubt if it’s the real-deal.

I just got my first Gesha from Volcan Azul this week and I really get why the bean is lauded - the taste and aroma are next level. The Gesha variety deserves praise, as much as it deserves an accurate name.

Coffee,"Hi, I'm not sure if this question goes here or better as a general question but I recently got my hands on a second hand. ROK espresso (the older model). This is my first time actually playing around with home espresso and I hope someone could give me so guidance on the ROK espresso or generally manual espresso machines or general tips for making espresso.

I have been looking at the conversion kit but I’ve found no store residing in EU that ships to Denmark yet.. I also have a hard time finding tampers, levelers and dosing funnels that has the diameter of the portafilter (49mm). The tamper ROK sells on their site says its 49,7mm which also confuses me. While these aren’t completely necessary I think they would make my life easier since the tamper I’m currently using is slightly too wide and too narrow on some ends which sometimes gets stuck inside the portafilter having me use force to remove it again..

I also would love if there were any Kinu m47 phoenix owners to give me any guidance on grind settings, I’ve so far tried 1.8.0 to 1.4.0 and 1.4.0 seems to be closer to the right amount.

I’ve yet to get any actual crema maybe a tiny bit at the end as most of my shots haven’t given me much resistance or I didn’t pre-heat properly, there is also ofc the factor that my beans were roasted almost a month ago, while I just opened the bag I think this factors plays into it bigtime. Having coffee lasting this long hasn’t been a problem for me since I tend to brew filter most of the time but I should receive some fresh beans in a week or so until then I still get to experiment with the ones I have. Until I get fresh beans I can’t really 100%tell if I’m just not applying enough pressure to get crema or its just the beans that are too old.

My coffee subscription is tailored towards filter, so I assume it’s going to be more lightly roasted which tells me I need to do a better job at preheating once I receive my fresh beans, am I correct on this?

There isn’t much guidance on the ROK espresso online and on YouTube which is why these questions pop up in my head. And before I invest into a leveler/Tamper/Dosing funnel I want to get the basics of the basics right like Dose /ratios/Brewtime/Grindsize/pressure/Temp/ ect.. I also want to learn more about the basics in general.

There is also one thing, I’ve never had any actual espresso before. I know crazy right? These lock down times really be messing with how I spend my money and time… Because of that I’m not entirely sure I’m deeply in love or know what good espresso taste like yet. I bought the Kinu grinder (also second hand) because I really enjoy pretty much all brew methods ranging from Moka to v60 to French press and anything in between but I also had a thought in the back of my mind that I want to dabble into espresso before, which is why I went with a secondhand option and got the ROK for a fairly cheap price. So far, I can’t 100% tell if I’ve enjoyed any of the shots so far but I don’t hate them either but I think should be able to tell once I get a lot of basics down and my effort of pulling a shot pays off..

So, to quickly sum up, I want tips and tricks for general espresso making and for using manual espresso machines like the ROK and how I should go about it like stuff like min and max dose/Yield/shottime/ all that fuss. In the meantime I will try and read about everything I can and understand espresso more before I go ahead and by useful accessories and such..and i would love if to see any suggested videos or threads surrounding this topic Espresso beginner here needing tips and must know hows for making espresso with a manuel espresso machine (ROK espresso)",sure question goes better general question recently get hands second hand rok espresso older model first time actually playing around home espresso hope someone could give guidance rok espresso generally manual espresso machines general tips making espresso looking conversion kit found store reside ships denmark yet also hard time finding tampers levelers dose funnels diameter portafilter tamper rok sells site says also confuse completely necessary think would make life easier since tamper currently using slightly wide narrow ends sometimes gets stick inside portafilter use force remove also would love kinu phoenix owners give guidance grind settings far try seem closer right amount yet get actual crema maybe tiny bit end shots given much resistance pre heat properly also ofc factor beans roast almost month ago open bag think factors plays bigtime last long problem since tend brew filter time receive fresh beans week still get experiment ones get fresh beans really tell apply enough pressure get crema beans old subscription tailor towards filter assume going lightly roast tells need better job preheat receive fresh beans correct much guidance rok espresso online youtube questions pop head invest leveler tamper dose funnel want get basics basics right like dose ratios brewtime grindsize pressure temp ect also want learn basics general also one thing never actual espresso know crazy right lock times really mess spend money time entirely sure deeply love know good espresso taste like yet buy kinu grinder also second hand really enjoy pretty much brew methods range moka french press anything also thought back mind want dabble espresso go secondhand option get rok fairly cheap price far tell enjoy shots far hate either think able tell get lot basics effort pulling shot pays quickly sum want tips tricks general espresso making using manual espresso machines like rok like stuff like min max dose yield shottime fuss meantime try read everything understand espresso ahead useful accessories would love see suggest videos threads surround topic espresso beginner need tips must know hows making espresso manuel espresso machine rok espresso

Coffee,"Hello all, 

To start off, I am a complete newbie when it comes to this stuff. I recently started making my own coffee, specifically Japanese Iced Coffee using the Hario V60 size 02. 

I've seen [James Hoffmann's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PApBycDrPo0&amp;t=59s) on it, along with [Kurasu Kyoto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqrGEWBOp4) but each time I brew it, the coffee comes out... to what I think is an initial acidic punch of flavor, then has a bitter taste towards the end (Please do correct me if I'm wrong, at this point I'm not even sure what to describe it as). Even when using two different coffee beans (still light roast however), both usually result in the same taste... is that how it's supposed to taste?

 **At this point, I'm not sure if I'm doing something wrong or if I'm just not used to the taste. I'd appreciate any possible insights towards this.** 

To give further info, prior to making these pour overs, I'm used to the sweet coffee from Dunkin Donuts along with Starbucks. I would either get a Iced French Vanilla swirl from Dunkin, or a Iced Caramel Macchiato from SB. I've also tried SB's cold brew to compare the taste, for me, it was slightly acidic then somewhat felt diluted afterwards. 

For these iced pour overs, my coffee beans are: 

* Panama Natural Elida Estate (Light Roast - Notes: Strawberry, Honey, and Tangerine), Fine grind
* Ethiopian Natural Yirgacheffee Wenago (Light Roast - Notes: Strawberry, Plum, and Apricot), Fine grind

What I've mainly been repeating thus far is Kurasu's method using 15g of coffee beans, 75g of ice, and 150g of hot water (205 deg F). Starting 30g of hot water for 30 second bloom -&gt; 60g after initial 30s -&gt; then finally 60g after the 1 minute mark.

Coffee,"Hope the question is straight forward, but I am very interested in how much do you actually let your beans degas before brewing it for the first time. I’ve seen a lot of numbers thrown around i.e.: 3-4, 5-7, 10-14(which I don’t really understand).

Is brew method or roast level a factor in this?

Coffee,"Hey there,

I enjoy making a good cup of coffee when on vacation at the beach. It's really one of the few times I really relax and take the time to make a great cup. However, I usually want to make coffee for 3 people, and often want a second cup after breakfast. We don't do cream or sugar, so I actually want real cups of coffee, not some tiny 4 or 5 ounce cup. We also like a strong bold brew.  


I currently have a javapresse grinder that gets the job done, but obviously isn't the most accurate/consistent, and it holds a relatively small amount of coffee. I also have a metal pour over filter. This obviously becomes quite a chore since the grinder and dripper/filter can't do enough coffee at a time for 3 full cups. I end up having to grind twice, which is both a bit time consuming, and a workout. I do not have a goose neck kettle or scale. I've always just kinda winged it on the coffee to water ratio.   


I'd like a better solution, that isn't gonna break the bank. I'm open to french press, moka pot, multiple v60's or whatever. I don't mind investing in stuff that will potentially get used at home as well, but I also don't want to spend hundreds of dollars on gear right now. I should note that the ranges in the houses I rent, are almost always crappy electric. Since we drive, we can bring a bit more stuff. However, I don't want to bring an entire coffee shop worth of stuff. Durability is also a consideration, since things get kinda stuffed into a roof box and such.

Coffee,"I'm having issues with the 1 and 2 scoop portion cups in my Cafe roma getting clogged frequently and the coffee not coming through, causing pressure in the coffee maker. I've tried using the poker that came with it to unclog the holes but there's just so many holes I can't possibly clear them all. 

I think there's grinds stuck in the space between the top and bottom space of the cups but I don't know how to clean out that spot. 

I've soaked the cups in a vinegar water bath and clean the whole machine regularly so there's no calcium buildup. 

I think it might be an issue of the size of grinds I'm using but I'm not sure what the proper size I need to use is. I usually just use a can of fine grind coffee or grind my own coffee in a similar size using a burr grinder.

Coffee,"As the title says, I have come to find that the info I've seen online about each ""click"" being 12.5 microns, is incorrect. 



The Dilemma:

I've had my JX Pro for about two months now, and I brew at least twice a day. Typically, pour overs with v60/Kalita or espresso with the Flair Pro 2. I record every variable about each brew I make, so I can go back to see what variables I need to change, and by how much. 

Allow me to define some terms, and try to set the scene. So far as I understand, a ”click"" is each setting/dot on the adjustment dial. So, each time it clicks as you turn the dial. By this understanding, 3.3.2 (3 full rotations, then number 3 on the dial, then the second small dot) should be 134 ""clicks"". If this is correct, then multiplying 134 clicks by 12.5 microns per click, gives us 1,675 microns. 

That's a whole millimeter and a half. I've read and watched enough about pour over grind size to know that about 400-800 microns is typical. So, I highly doubt that my 2 minute 45 second v60, that was dialed in based on grinding courser when bitter, and finer when sour, is actually at 1,675 microns, or french press size. 

My espresso has been dialed in to a 35 second, 8 bar shot at 1.5.2. That would be 62 clicks, and according to our 12.5 number, 775 microns. This is absolutely impossible. Average espresso is around 200 microns. At 775 microns, the ""shot"" would be done in an instant. 



The Solution:

So, my answer to this conundrum is that this idea of ""clicks"" is incorrect.

These numbers can be resolved by understanding that this 12.5 micron number is related to the actual numbers on the dial. Each number on the dial is 12.5 microns and each single click of the dial would, therefore, be 3.125 microns. 

By applying this to my pour over grind size, 3.3.2 yields 418.75 microns; well within the normal range. And when applied to the espresso grind size of 1.5.2, we get 193.75 microns, which is also right in the ballpark that it should be. 

Based on this, I think the number of 12.5 microns per click is not accurate, and rather, is per number on the dial. I hope this could help with anyone else who has the JX-Pro. Since it is gaining popularity quickly, I wanted to clear this up. 


Lastly,

I'd love to hear what you all have to say about my findings. Do you think I'm mistaken? Have I miscalculated something? Or do you agree? Should we change our language from ""clicks"" to numbers? For those of you that also have the JX Pro, what are your results? 

I'd love to hear your thoughts in the comments!




Edit: So, some have mentioned that the micron adjustment may be in reference to the distance between the burrs, rather than the particle size. If this is the case, and 12.5 is accurate, then can someone explain the correlation of the grounds being approximately 1/4 the distance between the burrs?

Coffee,"Since I have had my current grinder for (a knock feldgrind) for 4.5 years now, I've recently started to wonder about how long I should expect the burrs to last.

My rough estimate, at about 30g of beans a day, is approximately 50kg total. I don't know if that's a lot, or nothing in terms of wearing down the burrs (I definitely at least feel like I've built up a few very specific muscle groups, ha) in real world use.

And what's more, I don't really know how I can tell. I don't have a second grinder to compare to, and I assume any change/deterioration will be really gradual. I could inspect the burrs, but don't really know what I'm looking for, or what is normal.

Coffee,"I realize few people and recipes likely measure the actual slurry temp, or measure with a thermo pen the actual water of what their temperature kettle controlled kettle really is (instead just relying on the kettle temp display).

Thus, when I see recipes list as a water temp of 200-204F for example, I suspect they are referencing a kettle temp setting?

After reading Scott Rao about the difference between slurry temp and kettle temp, I discovered this about my Oxo electronic pour over gooseneck:

At 205F, after a pour into a vessel im immediately losing, as rao states, about 8F of temp - even up to 10F! And it drops a few more degrees in the course of a minute.

At 205F holding I get closer to a 203F hold, even though the kettle initially brought temp up accurately, and even though it says it’s holding at 205F, meaning I’m 2 degrees cooler during my pour overs than I thought after the first pour.

At 210F setting I can’t seem to get water to heat past around 207F on my therma pen. Holds temps around 206F. At my altitude boiling point should be around 211F so not sure why I can’t get the kettle hotter, but apparently 210F = 207F.

I double checked all this on a second thermo.

So, to the question: given that I instantly lose 8-10F upon pouring, should I be setting my kettle hotter to 210F in order to achieve an actual water temp in the SLURRY of around 200-202F at initial contact? This would be for a light roasted bean.

Or are the recipes online accounting for  the temp loss when pouring, and will those cause me to over extract? IE should my kettle be set lower to 205F, realizing I’ll be achieving a slurry temp of only 194-197 at initial contact with grounds and continuing to drop from there?

I also know that genetics could play a part in this, but coffee could also make me feel a bit jittery sometimes.

I’m guessing the reason that I sometimes feel more sleepy after drinking coffee is because it’s warm. I often feels more sleepy after drinking warm beverages. And sometimes I feel more alert because of the bitterness (this won’t explain the jittery tho). I remember I once drank a cup of very strong coffee at night and felt more alert than drinking the coffee I usually make. And it turns out the coffee I drank that time is decaf. 

I don’t really drink coffee for energy. It’s more for the taste, but I’m very curious about how caffeine could effect me differently.

Thanks for everyone who provided the possible causes of this. So, I’m thinking about recording these in a spreadsheet and trying to see how different factors affect me. Let me know if there’s any other factors that I should add. Thanks!

Coffee,"I need help finding a Clever Dripper recipe that yields full, rich coffee. 

I like extremely rich coffee - nearly (but not quite) espresso quality. I can get that with pour over pretty reliably. I'm trying to get the clever dripper to work for me because my wife (understandably) doesn't have time to fuss around with the v60. 

But every recipe I've tried with the Clever has been watery. Among others, these include:

* [Hoffman's method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOdennxP24): grind to med fine (~15 on my Encore, I think) 1:16.6 grounds/water (15g / 250g); fill with water first; stir; steep 2 min; stir; 30 sec; serve
* [Sweet Maria's method](https://library.sweetmarias.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Clever-Coffee-Dripper-Tip-Sheet.pdf): Med grind (22 on Encore); 1:15.5 (22g/340g); add grounds; fill + cover; steep 1.5min; stir; steep 3-4min; server

Hoffman's yielded straight up gross brown water. Sweet Maria's was pretty good. I preferred a 1:13 ratio with that method.

My questions:

* Do other people feel the same about Hoffman's method, or are my methods or tastes way out of whack?
* Has anyone found a good way to get richer coffee from the Clever? Different ratio, different grind size, different steep times... etc?

Thankfully it's been under control for a long time now, and I'm reintroducing foods my body found intolerable. Coffee is definitely the food that hurt the most, and thankfully I've been able to enjoy it a bit more lately. And if I'm going to enjoy my coffee, why not have fun being a bit snobby about it! (Just kidding) (mostly).

I spent some time in Israel a few years ago, and enjoyed a coffee in the Arab quarter of Haifa (gorgeous city, I miss it deeply). It was flavoured with cardamom— I'm not great aficianado but it was mayeb the best coffee I have ever tasted in my life. I'm back home in Toronto, and am on the hunt for a similar experience as this cardamom coffee. I asked a friend back in Israel if he was able to send me some of this particular coffee, which he was able to. Unfortunately, the seller had ground up the whole pound of it then and there. Obviously, the taste is just not the same.  

Too embarrassed to mention this to my friend, I've been searching around Toronto for a source, and I can't seem to find any cardamom flavoured coffee in the city (not unless it's a $3 back of instant coffee from the Israeli specialty store near my house).

Coffee,"Here is a recipe that I tried to piece together from the video James Hoffmann just released.

12 grams light roast, medium fine

200 grams water at 100° C

Non-inverted, no filter rinse, no bloom

1. Add 12 grams of coffee to Aeropress
2. Add 200 grams of 100° C water at a normal pour rate
3. Insert plunger to form a vacuum after water has been poured
4. At 2:00 mark, swirl Aeropress 4 times to create an evenly distributed grounds bed. Allow to settle until 2:30
5. At 2:30 mark, gently press until all water has been plunged and the ""hiss"" has ended. For me, a light plunge lasted around 20 seconds

The reason I went with this brew time was because James was showing swirl demonstrations that started at 2:00, and plunging that commenced at 2:30. Earlier in the video, he mentioned that there was a bump in quality with an increased brew time from 2:00 to 4:00, but that it showed somewhat diminishing returns. It would be interesting to try this recipe with a swirl at 4:00, and a plunge that started at 4:30.

Just trying to piece together the puzzle! I tried this recipe just now with Rao/Perger water and it was delicious. I live in Denver, CO, so my water unfortunately only comes up to around 94 C.

Something that I noticed was how much water you lose before creating the vacuum, and how little water escaped once you set the plunger. It looked like slightly less than 25 ml of water quickly ran through the filter, but was brought to a halt once I created the vacuum. After the vacuum was set, practically no water came through.

Coffee,"Hi r/coffee. Google had no insights for me so maybe someone here knows what's up. 

I had a thought that I wanted coffee flavored whip cream to put on top of a tiramasu cheesecake. I know all of the recipes call for instant coffee, but all I had on hand was my French press and coarse ground beans to make my morning brew. So I figured I'd just run the cream through the French press and whip it- what could go wrong?

I knew that temperature affected brew strength, so I steamed the cream before brewing. I used about a cup and a half of cream and 2 tablespoons of coffee grounds. I let it steep for three minutes and pushed it through. It looked and tasted really good!

I wanted to chill it before whipping so I threw it in the fridge for about two hours. There was a bit of a greasy film at the top at that point but I thought nothing of it. I added a bit of sugar and hot chocolate mix, and started whipping. 

It just...wouldn't whip. At all. I was using a hand mixer but I've used it before and it didn't take more than 5 minutes to get peaks. There was just nothing changing about the cream.

Coffee,"Hey everyone.
I've been kinda falling down the rabbit hole of coffee and that also means that I've started buying more expensive coffees from local roasters, rather than bigger commercial brands. I've enjoyed the taste of probably each of them so far, but even tho each of them was from different country and had different flavours, they all tasted almost the same for me and I could never have tasted the flavours (like cinnamon, chocolate, fruit, etc).
So my question is, what can I do to be able to taste the difference between various coffees? I read somewhere that Ethiopian coffee is the best if you want to start tasting these flavours, but I wanted to ask you all here.
Currently, I own a Moka pot and a frenchpress (I use frenchpress most of the time) together with a cheap 15€ blade grinder, but I am planning to buy Sage (Breville) Dose Control Pro with Hario v60, and then later in summer Gaggia New Classic.

Coffee,"tl;dr: Bialetti Venus always has ~50ml(of 300ml) water in the reservoir once only steam comes out. Is that 'normal'? What are the consequences when want consistent ratios? Should I just deduct that amount and calculate with less water?


Recently, I thought, with the new semester beeing online only again, it may be a good time to use my Bialetti as good as it can be. I got a Venus(?! The round one) and since day 1, there was always some water in the reservoir. 

From a laymans physics view(yeah, physics in med school was a joke), it seems logical to me.
A thermal system is quite chaotic and at some point, there is a ratio of steam to water, where its more likely to push up steam rather than fluid water. Thats the point where I consider the brewing done(the agressive steam hissing).

Then again, I always read(sometimes on this board) that a Bialetti should have next to no residual water, while in mine, its about 1/6th of the original amount(holds 300ml just below the steam valve)

This didnt concern me for a long time, as I always had preground and rather mild coffee, which I just piled up inverse to my level of tiredness and was fine with it.

Now that I spent some money on an 'ok' grinder(1zpresso jx pro- at some point I want to buy a real espresso machine. Maybe.), I'd like to fiddle around with exact ratios and having that much residual water kinda concerns me.

So, is this an inherent problem with Mokka pots or am I doing something wrong?(Iirc the noname pot at my last vacation flat in Italy had the same issue, though)

And if normal, when trying ratios that other other people advise, should I just calculate without those 50ml? So, for example, a 1:11 ratio with 250ml = ~23g coffee?

Coffee,"Is it just me or does coffee taste really good when you use expensive brewing equipment? 

For example, there are some things like glass or ceramic V60 cones, carafes, expensive scales, expensive Hario kettles that you don’t really need to make better coffee. 

In theory, you can get it done using a plastic V60 dripper, your cup under it and a cheap scale and a cheap gooseneck kettle. 

But whenever I upgrade to any expensive brewing equipment, I have this illusion of making better coffee and the coffee automatically tastes better, even though I’m using the same coffee beans, same grind, same ratios.

Coffee,"I’ve been wondering for a while if I may be doing something wrong. But I don’t get the point on ordering/making speciality coffee with milk.
I love to taste the different flavors that you can find in single origin or light roasted coffees and for me milk has been always a party pooper and only enjoyable on dark roasts (and I confess... it’s a good way to make horrible coffee drinkable).
Despite this, it seems like everyone is enjoying it more than solo coffee as it is the most usual order in a cafeteria.
I get that milk in v60 is a no go, but it should be fine on espresso and aeropress?

Coffee,"I recently tried V60 filter on my Stagg X, and I was amazed. I never thought V60 filters would be good on anything but V60/Origami. But to my surprise, it came out better than the V60. Acidity was much lower and flavor was bright and clear. I didn’t think it would be like that because cone shaped filters of course are not designed to go in flat bottomed brewers, and you have to fold the filter, which looks awkward. 

But I’m just here to tell that if you ran out of Stagg filters, which are pretty expensive and are only sold by Stagg, you NEED to try cone shaped filters on X.

Coffee,"I've always loved good coffee and have been doing single cup pour-over since before it was cool. I also have an Aeropress and a moka pot that see occasional use, but I'd never really weighed or timed anything and still used a cheapy blade grinder up until about two years ago.

Then last year, my wife was talking to a board members from her work (who know me as well) and they got to talking about how much I liked coffee. They told her they had ""some old"" espresso machine for years and never used it, so they wanted to give me. Turns out it was a mint condition La Pavoni Professional lever espresso machine from the early 2000s, complete with VHS instructional video from the factory. I found a T-80 café grinder to go with it for $100 and it was off to the espresso races!

I have probably pulled over a thousand shots in the last two years and I've been pretty happy with the results (just following the instructions included with it).

The group head started leaking the other day and I've been waiting for a new gasket kit to show up to rebuild it (I went big and ordered the piston kit with pressure gauge). In the meantime, I discovered James Hoffman and rediscovered my moka pot and Aeropress and fallen even deeper down the rabbit hole. My head is spinning with all the possibilities, but I'm still trying to focus on getting my Pavoni skills just right and trying not to drop ton of $$ on a big espresso machine.

Coffee,"There other day I picked up a bag of La Cabra (my first). I don't remember the exact name of the coffee, but it was from Bench Maji/Gesha Village which, incidentally, is where my all time favorite cup originated from. The roast date was, honestly, a little old at late February (particularly considering the price) but the barista recommended it and so I said sure why not. I was planning to use it for espresso, and knowing that lighter roasts need ample time for espresso I figured it would be ok.

It wasn't. At all. All shots that I pulled were lackluster, even as I was playing with different pressure and flow profiles, temperatures, differing grinds size, preinfusion etc etc. I couldn't find anything that have a satisfactory result. I then tried it as a pour over and experienced something I've never seen before. In my V60 after my final pulse there was a flat bed of coffee clearly visible beneath mostly clear water. I didn't use a refractometer or anything but when I tasted it it was just straight up sour and weak. It was probably the worst cup of coffee I've had (at least on the light roast spectrum—I've had a few really disgusting dark roasts which is inherently gross IMO). I feel pretty confident that this wasn't user error, but the reputation these guys have is pretty good. So what gives? Did I get a bad bag of coffee?

Coffee,"Hello fellaz,
I come to you with the hope of getting a few answers.

I'm a pastry cook working on the opening of a small shop and wanting to offer customers some coffee. Please understand that my main activity and knowledge is about pastry and lunch, not coffee.

 Coffee offered in the place will be espresso, lungo and, iced coffee and electric filter coffee. It's not a lot, and the offer will mainly be drinks made with a milk basis, and iced tea. 

I've read a lot recently on coffee, bout a book about it, and went to a couple of specialty coffee shops. Beyond the long chat about the variety of coffee and the many parameters that leads to a true espresso in the places , I really did not like it : it was way too acid, in both places. I've drunk better coffees in Italia and Turkey, yet they did not pretend to offer exceptional true specialty coffee. Maybe coffee was shitty, maybe baristas were shitty, maybe my tastes are shitty, maybe it's just not for me : I dunno and it's not the point.

In my place I wanna offer the coffee I know and like, and suddenly it comes to the choice of the machine. Ideally, i'd just buy a super automatic espresso machine that looks like a traditional one (marketing purpose) like Schaerer Barista, or WMF Espresso, but they are way too expensive (compared to the amount of coffee I hope I'll sell everyday).

Since I really want a traditional looking machine, i'd like to ask you people : what is, in your opinion, the best combination between tradition and regularly fair result since I won't hire experienced baristas (since I don't care about exceptionnal coffee flavors and variety, and it's not my main activity). I was thinking of an automatic 2 groups machine and two grinders.

Is it possible to set such devices up once and never modify the set up again so the person who will be selling for me only will have to push buttons? 

Thank you fellaz

Edit : I don't judge all specialty coffee shops, nor want to mislead people into thinking they drink specialty coffee around my place.

Coffee,"I love my AP - I get a consistently great cup using a 14:1 ratio, inverted, 200F, dialed in medium-fine on my JX.

I bought a Hario Switch because I prefer glass to plastic, and the cleanup is a little easier.  I figured the same recipe using the switch in steep/release mode should produce a very similar cup to the AP as I use it, as the process is the same: water sits with coffee for 2 minutes, then water is drained through bed.

It didn’t work out that way.  My AP cup is consistently perfectly balanced -  not a hint of sourness or astringency, sweet and smooth.  However, the Switch cup using the same recipe (plus a preheat with boiling water and some vigorous agitation at the end to mimic the AP flip) comes out sour. 

My question to you fine folk: WHY??  How can I get the same cup out of my Switch that I get from my AP?

Coffee,"A few months ago I started using an AeroPress and I love it! It's definitely my favorite way to brew and the only down side is that it doesn't seem to be a good option when preparing coffee for a small group of people. Anyway, I've seen varying recommendations for water temperature/amount of beans/brew duration so I'd love to see what people here suggest.

Here's my typical routine:

\-30 g of beans ground on the finer side

\-water temperature of between 180 and 190 ºF

\-brew duration of 5-8 minutes (occasionally stirring)

To top it off, I once saw someone on this subreddit suggest a pinch of salt to make the flavors pop, so I do that sometimes. Not sure how much of a difference it makes.

so maybe my points help you deciding if you wanna open a cafe in the future and consider that brand or type of machine.

so this machine is roughly 5 years old.... there is a technician coming in at least every second month fixing something only to come in next month because the scale is not working anymore ore one boiler overheats and i fear my life working on it because the last time some connection alredy exploded and 120°C (248 F) is mayyyybe to much for a brew boiler...

the buttons are all half broken and dont work every time you press it but somehow the cheap feeling lever for the steam survied 5 years, but also wiggles around a lot..

the options for the porta filters are either dildo or leather wich both kind of sucks for commercial enviroment, but at least one can clean the dildo one..

it still amazes me how a several-thousand-dollar WBC machine doesnt have preinfusion but instead has ""pre-brewing"" that does the exact opposite of lowering the chance for channeling.. it rips a huge hole in the puck by making a pause only to full blast a 9 bar hydro pump single stream  (yeah of cause the shower screen doesnt work but thats pretty standard for espresso machines tbf).

not even the eagle one has preinfusion... whyyyy?

it just isnt consistent at all too..

i really really hate nearly everything about that machine and i dont even wanna know what nice little ""features"" you get when you buy some lower budget versions of VA.

Coffee,"**Background:** Some of you may know me as the guy who [used milk instead of water in a V60](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/mfalkm/brewing_a_pour_over_with_milk_leads_to_bad_results/) from a while back, and you had suggestions (including one to yeet the whole idea into oblivion, but we're way past that). Several of you had suggested to do a cold brew instead. And of course, I was not going to let Reddit down. All figures are [in this link](https://imgur.com/a/Nfs6VQk).

**Experimental setup:** 240g of  Walmart brand whole milk [1] was added to 30g of coarse-ground, coffee [2] (28 on an Encore) in a French press (see Fig. 1).  The mixture was stirred until all grounds were saturated, and left undisturbed for 18 hours. The French press plunger was depressed, and the liquid was filtered through a V60 filter paper that was rinsed with cold water (see Fig. 2 and Fig. 3). The resulting 123.3g of cold brew concentrate was diluted 1:1 by weight in milk, and poured over ice (see Fig. 4). A metal straw was used to test the substance.  

**Results:** The liquid has a strong, upfront, milky texture, with minor roasty undertones. While the notes of ash are certainly not as strong as the V60, they are present, albeit muted. With a coarser grind and stronger dilution, it is expected that the method might result in a passable beverage. 3/10, do not recommend.

**Footnotes and references:**  
[1] It is certainly debatable what ratio to use, and whether the ratio should measure grams or milliliters (but absolutely not fl. oz.). For the ratio, a less concentrated version was chosen based on the poor results from the V60 experiment. For the unit, the density of milk depends on the composition of the milk and the temperature, see [3]. For simplicity, grams was chosen, and the temperature of the room was 22C.

Coffee,"Hi guys,

I'm quite new to espresso, I have a modest setup: delonghi dedica (with non pressurized basket) + sage (breville) smart grinder pro.

So I initially bought 2 kind of beans in the supermarket:

- light roasted 100% arabica from brazil (local brand): it was extremely sour, I couldn't even swallow it. Searching on the web I learned that it's intended for filter coffee and my dedica wasn't a good match for these beans, so I gave up. 

- dark roast starbucks 100% arabica: after my experience with the light roasted beans, my first coffee cup tasted amazing, however after some more cups I realized it tasted too much burnt for my liking. I used 17g coffee beans and produced around 34g of liquid coffe in around 30 seconds, so everything great except not my favorite kind of coffee. 

I then bought Lavazza espresso perfetto (medium roast) and so far my experience isn't good. I started from the recipe aforementioned and it was acid (not as much as it was with the light roasted beans, but the same kind of problem). I searched online how to fix it and the main solutions are:

- Increase the temperature: not easy with the dedica. I always run once with no coffee before in order to heat up the system, not much more to do here I'd say. 

- Reduce the dose: I went from 17 to 16 or 15, it seems to reduce acidity (some sourness still remains) but also the coffe tastes more watery (even if I also reduce the amount of water to keep a 1:2 ratio)

- Grind finner: grinding finner chokes the system. Playing with this and reducing the dose I managed to get a shot with almost no acidity, which tasted too watery, it took almost a minute and there wasn't a continuous stream of liquid coming out, just drops all the time.

I'd appreciate some pointers. 

Thanks in advance.

Edit:
I managed to get a shot with no acidity at all. What I did was to keep my dose (17g) and adjust the grind size (so fine that it seemed it was going to choke the machine, also most of the time there wasn't a continuous stream but drops), also adjust the yield so in the end my ratio is 1:3. With the aforementioned changes

Coffee,"Hello r/coffee!

I'm looking for a coffee grinder for a gift for a family member. I know they want one that  can grind roughly 80 g of coffee in a single shot.

So, basically...

\- I want to be able to hit 'go', let it grind as much as I need, and automatically stop (so, I guess the grinder needs to be able to be timed for  60-90 seconds). 

\- I don't want something with just an on/off switch--I want to be able to walk away and not worry it'll keep going. 

\- I also don't want to have to come back and press the button several times to get to 80 g. 

\- And, of course, I need a bin big enough to hold this amount.

Coffee,"Hi guys! I'm currently in the market looking for my first coffee machine to call my own as I prepare to move out. I originally was stuck between the OXO 9 cup, Bonavita 8 cup, Bonavita Connoseuir, and the Technivorm Moccamaster KBG. That was until I found the KBG Select as well, which just so happens to have more color selections available starting this month in the U.S. on their website (Matte Black, Polished Silver, Rose Gold, Stone Gray, Off White).

For all the Technivorm Moccamaster KGB and KGB Select owners here, what made you choose the Moccamaster model that you have, how long have you had it and how has it been holding up, and would you recommend getting it as my first coffee machine?

As far as I'm aware, the biggest changes between KBG and KBG Select is the addition of a switch to change brewing times for smaller volumes of coffee, as well as an independent hot plate to keep coffee warm up to 100 minutes. As for the showerhead...is it the same? 

Background: I've spent hours looking online at blogs, reviews, video reviews, Amazon reviews, and more and ultimately can't commit on a coffee maker that only has a one year warranty or has many reviews complaining about terrible customer service, water leakage, malfunctions after 3 to 6 months, and more.

Coffee,"I've gone through many phases of coffee infatuation. Espresso machines, Rancilio grinders, french presses, pour overs etc.  I still use all these machines but sadly what gets the most use now is a cheap Mr Coffee that's programmable. I need to get up real early for work with little time to fuss so I want hot coffee waiting for me when I go to the kitchen. The Mr Coffee does produce a warm, caffeinated liquid on a timed schedule that I've been living with.

Now, I'm tired of microwaving my freshly brewed caffeinated liquid to get it hot so I'm looking for another machine. Ideally, the machine will make 30 to 40 ounces of coffee that will be just brewed and waiting for me. It will be correctly hot, and the flavor will be good enough. I say good enough, because my preferences are for espresso or strong french press when I'm looking to enjoy the coffee.   

It seems that I'll likely have the same problem with anything inexpensive. The Moccamaster looks promising, but I'd need to put a timer on it, and some say the coffee cools quickly in the carafe.

Coffee,"With so many brew guides on YouTube and reddit, one will come upon 2 different ideas when it comes to final beds in a v60 brew. Some such as Elika from Onyx say that a valley shaped bed at the end is perfectly acceptable in they're methods, showing an even extraction. Others such as sprometheus and James hoffman swirl the brewers to get a flat bed in the end. They follow the idea that flattening the bed will let even amounts of water to saturate all the coffee. I have tried both methods and here are my results.

ONYX V60
-
I was very, VERY skeptical about this brew method. I have enjoyed onyx coffee for years but always opted for other brew methods. When on February they uploaded the ""easy v60 guide"" which uses heavy central pours and a final valley shaped bed I expected to get a sour and bitter cup at the same time, with underextracted flavors due to channeling, but to my surprise, I love the cup it produced. When I used different grind settings and dialed in coffees usually starting at 32 clicks on my JX pro, I found this method to produce some of the cleanest, boldest and sweetest coffees I have ever had. I have brewed a gesha from Honduras, a washed Ethiopian and a Natural Ecuador all using this method, and each one when dialed in has created an incredible cup. I was truly suprised.

JAMES HOFFMAN, SPROMETHEUS, RAO, ETC.
-
These brew methods all differ I'm pouring styles and brew parameters, but one thing they all have in common is a swirl to flatten the bed in the end. While the end bed is not everything, I have found it hard to get consist sweetness and complexity in these methods, often feeling that they finish flat and muted. I was surprised, I had brewed with the James Hoffman Method and enjoyed it for a year or so, but then switched to sprometheus and found the added central pour at the end provided me with a more bright acidity. Again, both had flat beds in the end, but these central pour methods seem to be producing better results in the end.

CONCLUSION
-
I'm split, I've been taught my entire brewing life that a flat bed at the end of a v60 brew is key to showing even extraction and producing a good cup, but following Onyx and Elikas valley and central pour methods, I have found more consistent flavors between coffees, and found everytime I brew, this lack of agitation and quick central pours has been a positive. My totally unscientific belief is that the coffee slurry when brewing is never flat, and that when you swirl at the end, you are actually clogging the slurry with fines, not creating an even drawdown as we think. I believe we over-extract those fine particles, and that a valley bed, or these central pours creating less agitation keeps flow rate up and clogging down. Overall, I'm very open to input in understanding these variables.

Coffee,"I've recently started trying to take more control of my coffee brewing and have been looking up recipes/techniques online and I have been pretty surprised at the specificity and level of detail in some of the recipes I have come across. Some of the recipes are so specific that they seem ridiculous and they really make me question how well these pros can actually taste subtle differences. 

For example, I don't have the link, but I saw an aeropress recipe that specified giving the coffee 5 stirs after the bloom, making a point to say ""not 4, not 6, 5"". Other recipes say they only use a specific brand of bottled water, or that the coffee must be ground no sooner than 30 seconds before adding the water. Now, I'm not saying that experienced coffee tasters can't detect subtle differences that us beginners can't, but it does seem to me that some of these recipes approach superstition to some degree. 

Noticeably absent from these highly specific recipes seem to be factors that could confound the extremely subtle specifications that they claim make their recipe perfect. For example, I have never seen a recipe indicate the proper elevation or ambient air temperature/pressure at which the recipe applies. Not that I think this would be a major factor, but for the recipes that stipulate that the grounds should be in the water within, say, 30 seconds of grinding, those factors would matter if they really believe they can taste the difference between 30 seconds post-grind and 1 minute.

I'm not trying to say that I don't believe any of these subtleties have real effects on the outcome of the coffee. Having put in some effort to do things such as grind my beans to the proper grind for the given method, control the temperature of the water, bloom, etc, I have definitely noticed differences in my coffee. But I am wondering what you all think about some of these very complex recipes and techniques, what factors you believe really make a difference, and what crosses the line into silliness.

Coffee,"I've recently started making coldbrew in my french press. I'm liking the results so far, however I'm struggling with one thing: after it's done brewing, I run it through a v60 with a paper filter, in order for the end result to be as clear as possible. This works great in terms of filtration, but takes hours to run everything through. I've tried priming the filter with hot water, which does seem to help a little at first, but quickly goes back to a painfully slow drip.

I'm using aerolatte unbleached filters. Would I have any better luck with some other brand, or bleached ones? I don't know much about filters.

Coffee,"Shout-out to u/Galbzilla and u/seblang1983 as your approach greatly improved my brew. 

For awhile I was getting fairly drinkable cups with a CD, blade grinder and good timing (don't judge). Recently I treated myself to a JX grinder. A cursory search suggested there was no rhyme or reason as to the appropriate grind size for the CD, but the most recommended was either medium or medium-fine, here and in youtube videos.

So I dialed in at 22 at first. Came out coarser than I expected. My first mistake here was not using more coffee. The result was watery and even astringent, bitter. Same with dialing in at 20, supposedly medium-fine (I think?). From memory, I've had to use so much coffee to get a strong result at a coarse grind in the french press that I would just get jittery, and this feels both unpleasant and wasteful. But the bitterness threw me off. I've been testing with a Costco / Starbucks house blend as my daily driver, which is fairly dark so maybe less forgiving. I tried using slightly more coffee and was still disappointed. 

I found posts of the aforementioned users suggested going as fine as possible without clogging. Ok. Intuitively this makes sense owing to extraction. My own previous blade-grind, though it looked inconsistent, had quite a few fine particles. I was apprehensive about possible bitterness, but tried it recently and... there was none. Just a smooth, strong cup. 

I think any ""technique"" here would be pretty forgiving. In the main you want to brew long enough, say 4 min. But check out their suggestion.

If you use a CD, are a cheap-ass (i.e. you don't like using lots of beans) and like strong-tasting coffee, then try going much finer.

Coffee,"For years I have been drinking drip coffee from a Mr.Coffee brewer. We grind at night, add the water, then set the timer and easy peasy morning coffee.

We've had a comically small french press for years now. It's primarily been used for tea, and for days when e just need a little coffee boost.

Anyway, we recently purchased a 1 liter french press. Since we're clumsy people, we got the metal one.

Now, we've used the smaller one for coffee several times over the years. I used the steel french press recently and.. it's amazing. The coffee is less bitter, it tastes smoother..and it has umami flavors!?

Historically, I've always consumed coffee with flavored creamer. I just thought coffee was supposed to be really bitter. I briefly tried getting into tea so I could reduce my creamer intake.

Coffee,"I'm an Atlantic Canadian. Coffee is... coffee. I had been just thinking about my trip to the Dominican on my honeymoon. I recall staying at one of the resorts and having a bag of generic coffee delivered each morning. Yellow bag, I dont recall anything of note as far as brand or anything of note about it. Just simple, no-name coffee.

What struck me about it was how potent it was. The coffee was really, really black. Almost thick. It was very stiff and strong. I really quite enjoyed it and I was surprised by how even a likely generic, low grade local coffee was so rich compared to back home. It just seemed like 'real' coffee.

I'm looking to buy a bag, whether it be whole beans or freeze dried, I'm not particularly picky. I'm looking for suggestions on where to buy it and what to look for so it's honest to goodness genuine stuff. I suppose it doesn't have to be Dominican; if Cuban or otherwise Carribean is a better recommendation, I'm all for it.

Coffee,"**Background:**

So I just switched from years of using a blade grinder to a Baratza Encore - conical burr grinder. I've been using a Ninja Coffee Bar - Model cf091 for a few years as well. I know in the highly pretentious world of coffee making, it is taboo to even use a drip coffee maker, none the less one made by Ninja that claims it can do a bunch of things beyond just a cup/carafe of coffee...

The truth is it's not tooo bad, anyone who owns it will tell you something similar. Can a better cup of coffee be made? Definitely, and for cheaper too. But its a well made and thought out machine. It's not a pain to clean and is fairly consistent. I'll probably switch to another method once the Ninja goes but for now I'm keeping it.

In trying to get the most out of my new grinder and my ninja coffee bar, I started researching the science and art that goes into a good cup of coffee. Upon learning the basics of grind size, coffee to water ratio, roasts, and brew time I realized before I even start with the grinder I need to know the basics of my brew method. Unfortunately, for anyone who's tried to get details on the differences of the different settings for the ninja coffee maker knows, those setting differences are not transparent or known. So I went ahead and repeatedly ran cups through to measure times and water volume.

[Ninja Coffee Maker Tests](https://preview.redd.it/shrvl52jfss61.png?width=549&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=37951d44d54714e9b77459e188bded8f4191b608)

**Experiment Notes:**

\-I did not use grinds as it would've been a waste of a lot of grinds and added another variable. You can expect to wind up with less coffee than the Total Water Poured as some coffee will stay with the grinds.

\-I did not test the 4 other sizes, it took enough time for these as is and use these settings the most. I suppose one day when I need to make a carafe I will test it out.

\-I pre-measured a cup and the Ninja Water reservoir, added the same amount of water to the reservoir each time and weighed the reservoir and cup afterwards to see how much water was used. The Total Water Poured measurement was how much water left the reservoir (and assumingly ran through the filter). 

\-The cup measurement (not included) was left out because it was almost always a few ml less than the reservoir measurement with a few drops being left behind in the filter which I wave-dried after each test as well. 

\-The reservoir was emptied after each test and new water poured, I didn't want to re-use pre-heated water as I wasn't sure if it would affect the machine.

\-I repeated the Regular Cup - Classic test twice to see if results were consistent and they mostly were (within 1 second each time). The amount of water drawn from the reservoir was consistent as well.

\-I started the timer when water initially began to pour and stopped it when I last heard/saw it pour, there is an initial heating and I guess cooldown period but considering it doesn't affect what's in your cup I did not measure that. 

\-I tried to measure the temperature of the water coming out of the machine however like I've read, the water cools down almost immediately as it hits the grinds so it's really hard to tell. I have an MK4 Thermapen though which is some top notch stuff and measured the water to be about ***198 Degrees Fahrenhei******t*** as it ran through the filter. It might be a few degrees hotter but this is generally in line with what's suggested (195-205). 

\-I don't pretend these numbers are extremely accurate but I'd imagine they are repeatable to within a couple of seconds and a couple of ml. The scale measurements especially the ml are probably more reliable. 

**Onward:**

Essentially the brew consists of an initial \~12-18 second pour (I believe called a 'bloom"" pour), a \~30 second to \~1 minute pause to let the grinds soak up the water, and a second pour which varied significantly depending on cup size/setting. 

I suppose now I will try to figure out how to make the most optimal cup of coffee based on this brewing method. Considering I cannot change how the machine operates what I can change is my coffee bean and roast, coffee grind size, and coffee to water ratio. If there is any advice for how to optimize my cup for each setting please contribute. I'm sure many drip users and specifically Ninja Coffee Bar users would find it very helpful. Not to mention it'd be an exercise in a person's coffee making ability. Thank you all and hope it helps! Feel free to discuss results as well, I was surprised by some of the machine methodology.

Coffee,"I recently purchased a Ratio 6 and kept having problems with the filter basket overflowing. At first I thought it was my grind size so increased it some (never had overflow issues with any other coffee makers although all of my others except one take #4 cone filters). The grind size didn’t really make a difference. Then I realized that the Ratio branded filters that come with the machine had to be the issue. They’re pretty short and have a very odd feeling that’s slick almost like parchment paper. I don’t think they allow enough water to flow through fast enough, causing the overflow. So I had the idea to try the BUNN filters because they’re taller and sure enough it fixed the problem. The coffee made with the BUNN filters tasted much better as well. Just a tip for anyone new to the Ratio machine. I was really disappointed in it at first but now really like it. I still prefer my Moccamaster though.

Coffee,"Note: the forum was super helpful over the weekend diagnosing issues with the pump. I’m hoping I can’t get a bit more help now that I’m past the frustrating point.

Here’s the update as of today: 

I received the new machine Friday and couldn’t get it to prime. In the end, after talking to tech support and trying a few things my husband managed to manually prime the pump by using a syringe full of air (to dislodge potential air bubble) and then full of water. To be honest it’s been quite frustrating just to get to this part.

Now I’m trying to dial it in w/ the Eureka Specialita and Im not getting good results at all. I started off with it fully dialed in with a freshly roasted coffee that works great on the PID Gaggia Pro Im using as the control group. I can’t quite figure out how to get the same results. 

Recipe on the Gaggia: 
- 1:2 yield in 30seconds at 94c is nice and syrupy 

In the MVII so far the best I can is definitely paler in crema and muddied taste. The best I got was - 1:2 in almost 40s at 94c. (And hitting 9bar on pressure gauge). Dose was lower than on GCP (17g) and it was longer. 

FWIW I have the preinfusion chamber installed.

So my question to La Spaziale owners is:
- on average did you grind finer or coarser? I can’t seem to find the sweet spot.
- what temp do you brew your medium dark roasts at? 

Any tips? So far the stuff I’m producing is wayyyyyyyy below what my Gaggia does. Like I don’t even have to try hard with the Gaggia to get good results and I’m at a complete loss here.

Coffee,"Hello! I've been sliding rapidly down the coffee rabbit hole the last few weeks and find I'm able to produce a decent brew with my V60. I'm using a Timemore C2 grinder, remineralizing distilled water according to the barista hustle spec as hot as possible, James Hoffmann's technique, and grind as far as I can go before channeling appears (generally at around 17 clicks).

My question is, although my coffee tends to taste good, I rarely get the flavor notes described on the bag. It happens once in an odd while, but in general the cups taste good, though not as distinctive as I'd like.

Do you have any idea what might be the limiting factor here? Am I expecting too much from a budget grinder? Or is there something I could be doing to grind finer without producing channeling? Could my technique be off? Or something I'm not considering?

Thanks for the tips!

Edit: Lots of responders are telling me not to trust the flavor notes written on the bag too much. This sounds like great advise, so thanks! I do however have the experience where one of the flavor notes written on a bag said 'peach' and the aftertaste of the coffee was so on-point, I wouldn't have been surprised if someone had laced my coffee with a few drops of peach juice.

Coffee,"~~I'm not sure if this has been ventured elsewhere on the internet.~~

Edit: sizing coffee grind distributions has certainly been ventured on the internet, but a public repository of grind size data?

Background: There's lots of great coffee grinders out there, and an even larger number of strong opinions about which to buy!

Problem: Many of these positions are subjective; meanwhile, coffee grinders are significant investments. I'd like a better grinder, but I'd like my choice to be justified.

Solution: collect more data!

Proposition: construct a public coffee grind size distribution repository (e.g. on Git?). I've purchased a set of ASTM test sieves which could provide histogrammed distributions (weight fraction between size x and y). With appropriate SOPs and a standard inexpensive nationally available bean (or a light and dark roast), the internet could send grind samples of the myriad range of coffee grinders owned by coffee Redditors to be sized.

Possible problems: test sieves may not provide sufficient granularity (a joke!) to distinguish different size distributions (the better option would be optical and light scattering methods, at which price point I would say ""hang the science, I'll just buy the expensive coffee gear."")

Coffee,"TLDR: I noticed way more fines from coffee that was ground with a local shop's Bunn grinder than I get with my stock Baratza Encore.

I recently bought a Baratza Encore to replace the cheap burr grinder that got me through college. It's absolutely changed my coffee game and I've noticed very few fines in my pour-over (at least compared to what I was used to). I've considered doing an M2 upgrade but don't feel like I need to at the moment. This is where my experience starts.

I ran out of coffee and wasn't able to buy more beans from my local shop (they're closed on Sundays) so my girlfriend just brought her coffee grounds when she was at my place so we'd be able to have coffee. I noticed that after she was done brewing, it looked like there was a surprisingly thick coating of fines at the top which I don't see with my grinder.

 It's the exact same coffee origin and most likely from the same roast as we each bought our bags one day apart. The only difference was that I grind my beans with my Encore, and her beans were ground at the coffee shop. They use a Red Bunn bulk grinder. [I think it's this one.](https://commercial.bunn.com/22100.0001)

My assumption is that a nearly $1000 grinder would be incredibly consistent, especially since the grind size was for pour-over which I presume is what that machine is made to be good at. But I'm thinking now that since the machine is made for speed it probably sacrifices consistency.

Coffee,"Hi. I am using Barista Express for several months now. I have a CJ4000 scale that I use to measure beans and output liquid. But I am not getting good results.

I've been trying to get some definite criteria based on which to produce my shots. You are supposed to get a ratio of 1:2 for 20-30seconds but since there is a two-sided discussion whether that includes the preinfusion time or not - it does not make my life easy. In addition, from reading and watching I already know that this time range is not a target, it is a kind of indicator but not end target. Well I am not with a lot espresso experience and thus cannot use my taste to determine whether the shot is good or not. So with that huge window (20-30 seconds) and a wide range for grind coarseness I have no way of knowing whether I am on the right track or not. I could make 34g out of 17g in so many ways (combinations of grind size and duration). I need to fix one more variable.

Coffee,"Okay so I'm not a coffee expert, nor do I claim to be. I do however grind my beans fresh, and I use the James Hoffman method with my french press. My coffee tastes exceptional for the first few sips, but as I go on, it becomes more and more bitter and I can't figure out why. There's barely any sediment once I'm done, but starting at the halfway point it starts to become bitter. I do know that my grinder is quite low end, and I believe that it's most coarse setting is still too fine for a french press, but could that really be affecting the extraction as much as it is?

Coffee,"I’ve been involved with coffee for quite some time and somehow just got my first bag of Burundi with Potato Taste Defect (PTD). I opened the bag and BOOM...raw potatoes. The smell was SO distinct. This came in Mpemba from Counter Culture.

I’ve watched their videos and read up on things a bit, but thought it was time to turn to the community here for input. 

It seems like the recommended method for “saving your beans” is grind small batches - If it smells like potatoes, throw it out. This is not an issue for me as I single-dose everything anyway. 

My question though - has anyone found more successful methods or science that can identify which beans are the culprit. It’s super fascinating to me that this impacts individual fruit and not the whole plant!

I was thinking of sifting through the bag at about 5g at a time to try and more precisely hone in on the impacted beans and hopefully save some extra, rather than throwing out a full 18g dose.

Coffee,"So, I decided to undertake the alicorn alignment this afternoon. There are a few pieces that are giving me a bit trouble.

First, I’m working on sanding down the 3D spacers. I’ve been at the first burr for about a half hour, and it keeps failing the dry erase test. (Making sure the spacer is flush with the edges of the burr). The spacer really feels like it is flat with the edges of the burr, but when I apply dry erase marker to the rim on the bottom of the burr, it isn’t getting sanded away. There is a lot of fine plastic dust that is generated when I sand the spacer down, so I’m not sure if that is preventing the marker from being wiped away. It seems to be coating the rim of the burr.

I have also noticed that my grinder now sounds different when it runs. It sounds louder, somehow more powerful than before. I have a feeling that this has to do  the hex screws around the rubber belt. It honestly sounds more like what I expected when I purchased the grinder, but I have no way of knowing if it is normal. I tested the belt to make sure there was no friction before reassembling.

I am waiting to finish the job before trying to run any coffee through it, but the post-alignment dry erase test had such great results. It was really uneven before I attempted this procedure.

Coffee,"I have been working on a way to formulate a solid cbd recipe and have been having issues. The first and biggest problem I have is that cbd isolate, while tasteless is not water soluble, which is a problem since coffee is water based. This results in having cbd floaties in my coffee which really doesn't affect the taste very much but makes the mouth feel a bit weird. The bigger problem is that without an oil the cbd doesnt metabolize the way it should, which keeps it from releasing fully in your blood stream and making this almost pointless. Adding mct oil would create an oil slick on the top of the coffee and makes it just weird. 

I could get an emulsifying creamer and that would work just fine, the problem is I hate coffee with creamer and want to make this a black coffee. I am wondering if any of you know of a tasteless emulsifier to use. Or the bigger question I have for espresso machine owners out there is to try this and let me know if the oils preserved in the coffee due to a paperless extraction allow the cbd to properly mix with the coffee. 

Also I know the easier solution is to just take cbd separately from coffee but I very much want to find a way to make this drink work because it would be very cool.


Update:
After much testing I've come to determine the espresso will likely work but could make the crema really weird. My plan now which honestly seems quite sinful in the coffee world is to make a shot of espresso then add that to cold brew and make it a nitro cold brew to bring it together in a nicer consistency.

Coffee,"I shall apologize in advance for the long post ahead, but I am really confused at the moment so please help me out;

&amp;#x200B;

Is it possible to have a cup of both over-extracted and under-extracted pour-over?

The tasting notes I get shows that:

\[Sour, Vegetal\] ==&gt; under-extraction;

\[Astringent, Drying, Gainy\] ==&gt; over-extraction;

&amp;#x200B;

The equipment I am using for pour-over is \[Fellow Stagg Pour-Over\], \[1zpresso K-pro Grinder\], \[Temperature controlled gooseneck kettle\];

I am brewing fresh (7\~14 days since roast) medium roasted beans from local roasters; I have had success with immersion brews so the beans are not likely the issue;

&amp;#x200B;

In the process of troubleshooting the brew, I tried:

1. Water: filtered water, purified water, bottled mineral water, all similar results;
2. Grind size: Basically, everything from Fine to Medium Fine to Fine, all similar results, with Finer grinds being harsher (more vegetal and drying) and Coarser grinds being very weak; All of them taste over-extracted and under-extracted at the same time;
3. Temperature: everything from 200F to 205F; no difference;
4. Ratio: 30g - 500g consistent; I didn't really change this too much;
5. Technique: I would normally start with a 2x bloom of 30 seconds, and start pouring at a steady pace until 500g; my brew time ranges from 2:30-3:00; I couldn't really stretch it any longer without going too fine; the drain was very consistent and the coffee bed was very even;

Coffee,"A year ago my wife accidentally mixed two types of beans, one light roast and one dark. Both single sourced coffees from two continents.

We mixed some more and the result was and is consistently phenomenal. I feel bad about mixing two otherwise great single sourced coffees like that but the bastardized result is just too good to pass on. Is this kind of  home blending something people do or is it frowned upon ruining great single sourced beans by mixing them? Even if it is I won't stop doing it.

Coffee,"I'm having problems getting extracting the right aromas from some single  origin beans. The beans (light roast, carbonic-macerated) and grounds  smell good, so it's not a bean problem. I'm using a V60 with Hario paper  filter, Timemore C2 hand grinder.

The  body of the brew fits the profile that the roaster intended, but the  aroma of the brew is disappointing. The aroma smells like a typical,  underwhelming pourover coffee (I'm not sure how to describe this scent,  it's something that you might smell if you blended 100+ different beans  and brewed it), and what I hope to achieve is to extract and accentuate  the desirable flavour notes, instead of this basic flavour.

Which  variable should I focus on to extract the intended fruity, boozy  aromas? I used a 1:16 ratio for a 15g brew, 2 part pour (half volume,  followed by another half) with a 3min brew time as recommended by the  roaster.

Coffee,"I normally use Virbant's V60 method.  2-1 to 3-1 bloom for 35 seconds, then pour to 60% including bloom from :35 to :55, let it draw down then at 1:30 pour rest of water to 100% aiming to be finished around 1:55. 

I am going to try a Hario Switch in a similar fashion. Switch closed.  Same bloom, then continuing pouring the first main pour with switch closed.  Leave switch closed until 1:30 mark, then open it before doing the 2nd main pour.

&amp;#x200B;

I assume, all else equal that the immersion phase of the first 60% of water until 1:30 will allow for more extraction but I have no measurements to calculate the extraction percentage.

Coffee,"I’ve struggled with my coffee brewing for months now despite switching to primarily using the Clever dripper. It has the reputation of being forgiving and consistent, yet I felt I had the opposite. I’d get a decent to good cup and then do the same thing the next day and it would be dramatically worse. Sometimes I’d have a hard time even getting a decent cup at all. This was my experience before the Clever, but I thought switching would resolve it. But I was wrong. And it was super frustrating.

I usually use water from a Brita filter. But a few days ago I decided to try using straight tap water. Immediately I felt like there was a huge improvement. I thought it could be a fluke, so I didn’t immediately come here to post. But over the last few days, every cup has been at least decent, with a couple really good cups. And they’ve been relatively consistent as well. 

Here in Portland, OR, tap water is excellent, but we use a Brita just to filter any other potential stuff we don’t want. I had no idea I was actually hurting my coffee brewing though. I guess it’s already so soft, filtering just made it worse rather than better. I could still be wrong. I haven’t been too scientific about this. But it makes me wonder if I’m alone or if others have noticed Brita water making their tap worse for their brewing?

tea,"I think these might be called sun-teas? But in this case not necessarily being put in the sun... I wanted to ask if we get a lower nutritional takeaway from making a vegetable or flower water than we would from blending it or boiling it? I read recently about okra-water, where you put the sticks in a mason jar, cover to the top of the sticks in water, leave it overnight and then drink the water the next day. I have had a mental block about consuming the moringa leaves I have ( I usually blend them and it's gross) so tried the water method, the water was a lovely clear-medium-green the next day and it wasn't gross at all to drink. Is this a wonderful hack that people don't really talk about? Or am I getting less out of the plant than if blending it. Before you answer please keep in mind: (i) I dont believe in using the powder form as it grows everywhere in my country and would rather go with fresh (ii) I'm not worried about losing out on fibre if that was going to be one of the points being made, as I'm vegan and get it in abundance [veg or flower] water vs tea"

tea,"
1st steep refreshingly vegetal, savory and mouth coatingly buttery. Very fresh, wet leaves smell like steamed spinach. 

2nd steep is just as savory, thick, and fresh. Not much change. 

3rd steep the flavor does begin to fade a bit, but the texture is still good. Not bitter or scratchy. Still enjoyable. 

4th steep does start to get bitter, but it isn‚Äôt scratchy, which is surprising. It gets less pleasant to drink when it cools down, so this cup got drank quickly. 

5th steep is not enjoyable, the texture crashed and so did the taste.

I like tea with strong, bold flavors without much bitterness.  The Bigelow Oolong is dark and slightly fruity like the hot tea I've gotten at Chinese restaurants.  I've tried other Oolong teabags that were lighter and more grassy/buttery.  

A lot of the loose Oolong I've looked at sounds like it's more the lighter flavor profile.  Any darker, stronger Oolongs that are fairly inexpensive?  Or any strong but smooth black teas like breakfast tea?  Also open to tea with spearmint or fruit added. Looking to try moving up from teabags to loose tea, need some recommendations"

tea,"Hi guys I've just started getting into tea somewhat recently and it's been an amazing journey so far. So I've experienced what in English is described as getting ""tea drunk"" twice, which I guess is mainly a very controlled caffeine buzz. I'm not sure if anyone can answer me this here but I'll ask anyway. So I'm researching different information on ""tea high/drunkenness"" and have come across two different viewpoints on it. So it's a very appealing and desired quality in the English world, aka having a very attentive but controlled mental state that is very pleasant. But when I look it up in Chinese, Ëå∂ÈÜâ (tea drunk) it is a very negative quality, like they compare it to actually getting drunk and having similar side effects like headaches, nausea, etc. However, I've been researching more into Puerh and found that it does have some special effects like making you feel this heat in your body and giving you that supposed elevated mental state. The word Ëå∂Ê∞î (tea energy? idk) is commonly associated with puerh and it's psychoactive effects. So my question is, are the effects you get from drinking Puerh noticeably different than from drinking other teas? Or can you have the same effect by drinking a higher amount of any other tea? If anyone knows chinese, can you explain the difference between the two and which one is supposed to be positive, and which one is negative? I appreciate everyone's help.

tea,"Hi! Following up over a year ago [when I asked for recommendations on tea storage solutions](/r/tea/comments/ep54oy/i_want_to_accumulate_tins_for_storing_my_tea_but/). 

I ended up going the route of the Ikea BLOMNING tea canisters. I was quite happy with [how they looked](https://i.imgur.com/o822Yj2.jpg), but sadly the experiment proves to be a failure due to tea degradation. 

## Background

In February 2020, I ordered several black teas from Teavivre and dumped them into the tea tins. I also ordered some vacuum sealed sample size (5g) packets of the same teas from the same harvest. 

I have 15 teas stored in the small tins and 10 teas stored in the large tins. Over time, I noticed I've been enjoying the tin-stored teas, which used to be my absolute favorites, less and less. 

## Experiments

I decided it was finally time to break open the samples and do a blind head-to-head comparison of the vacuum sealed samples versus the tin-stored teas by brewing each back to back in the same gaiwan with the exact same grams of tea, temperatures, and brewing times.

The difference was striking.

### Experiment 1

My girlfriend and I started with the Premium Golden Monkey black tea. She didn't know which one was the vacuum sealed and which was the tin stored. She identified the vacuum sealed easily after trying both, citing that it tasted fresher, more complex, and with a better mouthfeel. I imagined I noticed the difference as well. 

### Experiment 2

For the next experiment, I was the blinded one - she handed me two identical weight cups of the Bailin Gongfu black tea and I brewed them up. The vacuum sealed tea was the obvious winner not only in taste and aroma, but  also had much better coloring. As compared to the [vacuum stored tea's coloration](https://i.imgur.com/8Ah1a0v.jpg), the tin-stored tea had [way less caramel colors and looked very muted ](https://i.imgur.com/eFnkljK.jpg). 

[Here is an imgur album with all of the photos](https://imgur.com/gallery/vhxp6QI).

## Next

After some research into caviar storage, where degradation is absolutely unacceptable, I think the metal of the tin and perhaps the insufficient sealing may have contributed to the loss of the teas in these tins. I will be trying mason jars as my storage system for the next year, as initially recommended by /u/Dark-Arts over a year ago, and put to test their very plausible claim:

&gt; the recommendation to instead use poorly sealing Ikea tins ignores the greater degrading effect that exposure to fresh oxygen has on delicate teas. I would suggest that a tightly sealed air-tight transparent glass container kept in a dark cupboard would provide better tea preservation than an opaque but poorly sealing tin. Not sure if this has ever been studied scientifically but it seems plausible to me.

Second I would like my teapot to have a metal strainer.  Do you find that the holes in the ceramic filter tea nicely?

My first choice that I am REALLY loving is this set right here: ([https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07N91YTCZ/ref=ox\_sc\_act\_title\_1?smid=A2F81YYJAPCP0L&amp;psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07N91YTCZ/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=A2F81YYJAPCP0L&amp;psc=1))

Now in terms of the set itself it has EVERYTHING I am looking for. Its a nice size with it being able to make a nice amount of tea, it has a metal strainer, and it looks beautiful. But my only problems is that its a bit more expensive then I was hoping and it doesn't come with a case (From what I can tell). This is also my first tea set so I don't know if it would be a better option to get something more basic or cheaper to start with.

The other options I was looking at are these ones:

* [https://www.amazon.com/Ceramic-Portable-Teacups-Canister-Suitable/dp/B08T5X4FBV/ref=psdc\_367228011\_t1\_B08Q4HJDVC?th=1](https://www.amazon.com/Ceramic-Portable-Teacups-Canister-Suitable/dp/B08T5X4FBV/ref=psdc_367228011_t1_B08Q4HJDVC?th=1)
* [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08PT15N64/ref=ox\_sc\_act\_title\_2?smid=A14CQG1BN8EZC&amp;psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08PT15N64/ref=ox_sc_act_title_2?smid=A14CQG1BN8EZC&amp;psc=1)
* And other similar products

Now these are much more in my price range and come with a traveling case. But a lot of the time they aren't  that Kyusu shape and I am afraid of not getting the benefit of the Kyusu shape. These also tend to be smaller in size and not have the metal strainer.

I suppose my  ""perfect"" set up would look like this:

1. Has a Kyusu teapot that can hold more than 300ml
2. Has a metal strainer (If this is really more beneficial)
3. Comes in a set
4. Has a carrying case
5. Is under $40 

Now basically my question is what do you think is the best option? Or is there a completely different option that fits my needs  even better? I am also trying to figure out if I even need certain specifications. For example I know the Kyusu is used for Japanese green tea. But I am going to be using this primarily for herbal tea like chamomile. I know there is a chance that I am over thinking all of this and I should just pick something and start but I want to make sure I get the best thing for the price. Any advice is greatly appreciated!

A chapter I'm currently working on must include someone who's an expert in tea. Especially green tea, as that's the one being mentioned the most. 

The character is not a professional cook or any of the sort, it's actually a mother in her 30s, who's a tea lover. She's sitting in the living room, when her daughter brings her a cup of green tea. The mother explains to her the process of tea making, the culture and how to describe tastes, smells and etc. of tea. 

This is where I need help, as I know barely anything about tea, and even less so about green tea.

I don't wanna sound like a pompous jerk who wants to appear refined, but a lot of desserts, drinks, etc, now are just waaaaaaay too sweet lol. After drinking some high quality Longjing and discovering how sweet it is just by itself, I can't imagine adding sugar to it. It hinders and takes over all the other flavors.

To get it back to 212 you have to reset the temp to boil (spin and press), then set it back to 206 and hit keep warm again after it comes to temp and you infuse (spin press and press). That gets a bit annoying brewing gongfu repeatedly. It would be nice if there was one out there that brought it back to 212 at a press of a button.

Third infusion, 48-54C and 100ml of water 2.5 minutes

Fourth infusion, 50-60C water and 100ml of water 1.5 mintes

I didn't do any more than 4 because it was getting late and Gyokuro is higher in caffeine.

tea,"Hello! 

I'm very new to the world of tea. I grew up in a Mormon household so I was literally religiously forbidden from tea (stupid I know).

Anyway in the last few months I've been trying to live healthier and that started with moving off of diet soft drinks and trying herbal infusions. Upon researching infusions I learnt about the so called super fluid known as green tea. Curiosity led me to try and here we are. Now, my first foray into green tea was cheepo tea bags from Aldi. ""Diplomat"" branded tea bags, 1 box of mint green tea and 1 box of lemon. It's... not great. At least the mint one has actual mint leaves, the lemon one is ""lemon flavouring"". Yeah I should have read the ingredients before purchasing but it was a whim and I have anxiety and stuff and I wasn't alone and yadda yadda.

Anyway I'm actually enjoying the hot beverage even though it's not great, flavour is very weak (been looking up how to brew it properly, yes I pour the water over the bag, yes I let the water cool a couple minutes first, yes I only let it steep a couple minutes)

I was reading that more expensive tea has more flavour and leaves are better than bags but I don't know my way around local brands. I looked up a product review site and people here seem to like Lipton and twinnings, but only specific flavours and I don't think 40 reviews is a good sample size on rando review site.

Anyway this is Just a long way of asking what's a good brand to look for in Adelaide, preferably at Coles cause it's close and anxiety and all that but I might get the courage to roam a bit further, maybe. Woollies is also pretty close but not as. 

Also if it's free leaves do I need to buy one of those cage things with a handle? I know people used to just put the leaves in the tea and drink it with the leaves in the cup (how else was tea reading ever a thing?) but people don't do that any more?

Thanks for the help!

1st steep is very pleasant, I brewed this tea at 180¬∞. The scent is very umami and it‚Äôs delightfully savory and full in body. Almost broth like. Very much like a sencha in my opinion, but I enjoy it more than the sencha I‚Äôve tried so far. Sweet in a roasted veggie way. 

2nd steep is much the same, buttery and savory. Enjoyable even when cooled to just slightly warm. 

3rd steep is slightly grassy as it goes down, but not in a way that is unpleasant. Still holds onto the rich body. Pairs well with a sweet snack now vs. the savory sesame mochi I had. 

4th steep Saw little change.

Now, I have stopped buying tea for a while, but what I got is already totally overwhelming. I can probably drink 15g of teas each day and I got something like 5kg of teas with me now, half of them are aged white teas or purehs, so it's the rest that I need to be worried about. I already shared a lot of the stuff I got from Taiwan with my tea loving friend. I share some with my mum as well but she is more into English teas.

My strategy so far is to consume the tea in the order that they'll go stale, i.e. the dragon wells, anji white tea and other green teas first, then Taiwanese oolongs, then Chinese oolongs and other black teas, and I can take my time for the aged white teas and purehs. 

Some of them are vacuum packed so I'll start with the non-vacuum pack ones first. I try to keep everything sealed after opening, and I keep only 5 to 6 teas opened at a time.

I have put my opened anji white tea in small packets in the fridge as instructed by the store. Opened greens, oolong and red teas are sealed in their original packaging with ziploc, or inside an airtight container. The aged white tea came in seal plastic wrapping so I kept them in those and just put them in a cardboard, along with my Puerhs which are in their original paper wrapping. 

Is there anything I'm doing wrong here? Or am I totally overreacting and should just relax and enjoy my tea? I'm just worried that I would ruin these amazing teas and let them go stale!

Now I can present this Mudan Tong Mu (sort of), which originally had a bright poppy seed, malty, zesty taste with a hint of muscatel and mineral notes. The peony brought forward the sweeter notes like black locust flower, elder flowers and honey with the obvious peony scent.

tea,"As a Brit I've never really considered how weird it is to drink tea like we do. Most other places have tea either with lots of milk or none at all. We just have a splash - and it MUST be cold. This morning I learnt why listening to a podcast episode on tea on my commute... turns out it's all to do with the quality of crockery!

Apparently working class Brits couldn't get the fancy porcelain cups from China, so took to making their own out of bones, known as ""bone China"". The problem was it was such bad quality it would sometimes explode when boiling water was poured straight into it. People stopped this by pouring some cold milk into the cup or teapot beforehand, reducing the temperature shock. 

This also shines some light on the ""tea or water first"" debate we have here. My thinking has always been water first if you're brewing in the cup (so you get the correct brewing temperature) and milk first if using a tea pot (as it self-mixes without using a spoon). 

Which side does everyone else fall on?

tea,"I've never really liked RED TEA Á¥ÖËå∂ (fite me) before buying this awesome Golden Monkey RED (ok I'll calm down). It's actually very flavorful and delicious, but for some reason the last two times I've brewed, the flavor drops sharply after the second or third steep. I was wondering if this is due to temperature control? I'm just using an old tea kettle lying around, so after hearing it up to around the correct temperature the first time, the temperature just drops over time somewhat quickly. Plus I have the AC sitting around 78 degrees lolo.  It's still hot but not where my fingers get burnt holding the gaiwan. Is the reason the flavors aren't brought out so much affected by the drop in temperature? I guess I kinda assumed that, the first pour is to open up the leaves, and the rest is to soak up the flavors. 

Tldr Should I keep a relatively constant temperature with each infusion in order to maximize the flavors?

edit: I'm using Gongfu cha method btw Dumb question, but does the temperature have to be the same throughout each infusion?"

I'm looking for a nice tea to get my dad for Father's Day. With mail being super slow these days, I'm hoping to order early so that it arrives on time. I'm not super educated when it comes to teas, so I'd love some advice from the pros :) 

I got him [this tea](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00YIRK96Q/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) last year and he loved it so much that he asked me to reorder it. I got lucky with that pick and would totally buy it again for him this year, except he doesn't want me to get it for him anymore after he found out how much it costs (won't be making that mistake this year!) He really likes green and oolong teas, but nothing too floral or fruity (jasmine is okay). What would you recommend? Gift suggestion for my Dad?"
tea,"About talking to a main founder of the modern Russian tea tradition about cultural themes.  He is credited as a primary influence, by a number of Russian tea vendors and enthusiasts that I've spoken to.  This talk was mostly just an introduction, not getting far with themes like Russian uptake of Chinese tea tradition forms, and Taoism and the I Ching as fields of personal study.  Bronislav started studies and works as an academic interest, with tea club and group development as an outgrowth of that.  That last step mainly occurred over the 1990s, now somewhat integrated in an established subculture in Russia.

tea, Tea for one (or 3?)
tea,"There's a heat wave here and I need to figure out how to cold brew my tea! Most recipes I'm finding say how much to use by volume but I have several different kinds of loose leaf green tea, in all shapes and sizes, so I'd love a recipe by weight. Leaf to water ratio for cold brew tea?"
tea,"Good morning! I am new (ish) to the wonderful world of tea. I grew up in the southern parts of the US where sweet tea is *the* drink, but was never able to enjoy it. As I got older, I continued to try to enjoy other types of tea because of the ""advertised health benefits"" *(the rules say not to discuss the ""health benefits"" due to the complexity of the subject, but I mention it for context. I'll edit it if this isn't ok)* and even worked for Teavana for a short period of time; it's also my favorite reason of termination (""I just don't think you have the *finesse* for tea.""). All to no success or enjoyment.

I'm a big fan of the show Avatar the last Airbender*, and that's one of the reasons I have found the light: I read a post that used Uncle Iroh's love for jasmine tea to underscore the complex character writing for the show. For those of you unfamiliar, Iroh is considered one of the best characters because of his deep wisdom and incorruptible patience. The post went on to describe how patience is necessary to brew more delicate teas like green and jasmine tea, lower temperature is recommended, etc. My bestie happened to have given me some extra green tea she had, and I finally have a big girl cooking thermometer; the tips worked! So here I am, that's my tea journey. I'm glad I stuck it out and kept trying. 

On to the discussion (if you read it, thanks for listening!).

So I've been getting into this tea thing, and I started looking into kettles (because right now, I'm just heating water with a sauce pan lol); which lead to trying to find what the best material for kettles should be; lead to an article (I think I found on Reddit, no less) that described the which kinds you should use and why. Silver was the winner (after gold, but it's so lavishly unattainable), followed by glass, and then steal and stainless steel. Now, I agree with Uncle Iroh when he says, ""The best tea tastes good whether it comes from a tin cup or a porcelain pot,"" and if I spend the rest of my life heating my water in a sauce pan, that will be 100% ok with me. But I'd be lying if trying a cup of tea from a silver pot doesn't get me going a little. 

Fortunately, silver pots come at a very cheap price of $2-3k (/s). So probably not gonna happen for me any time soon. 

I do have a small peice of real silver. Idk the purity level, but it has the iconic *ring* that silver makes when clinked, and when I placed ice on it and a metal spoon, the ice on the silver melted faster. According to multiple sources, those are real ways to test whether silver is real or not. It's just a small jewelry container, though, not nearly enough to fill a cup, much less a pot. The article I read tested the effectiveness of the silver by pouring water boiled in a clay pot into a silver one for 10 minutes. The both waters were poured into cups and random strangers were asked to taste them and identify if one tasted ""different."" 96% of the time, the silver water was identified as ""better."" 

So with this in mind, what I'm thinking is that if I place my silver doo-dad into the water for a short time before steeping my tea, that it will give me a better tea, right? I'd love a discussion, but I'm definitely gonna try it, anyway. 

Tl;dr: silver has been shown to be the best method for brewing tea. I can't afford a silver kettle, though, so I'm going to test this by placing a silver trinket in my water. Updates provided in comments. Thoughts, comments, and suggestions welcomed!

*If you've never watched the show, I highly recommend it. It's supposed to be a ""kids show,"" but I'm almost 30 years old and I still love it. It's aged well, well written, has complex characters and is known for its incredible character development. I'm gonna be restarting it soon to celebrate my new love for tea!

However out of abundant enthusiasm and curiosity, I ordered a lot of flavored teas from Harney‚Äôs and David‚Äôs that I did not enjoy(eg chocolate chai, macaroon and s‚Äômores flavored black tea etc). So question is, what do you do with boxes of tea that you don‚Äôt like? None of my friends drink tea so donating them is ruled out. 

Any ideas or suggestions welcome :)

Thank you. What do you do with tea that you don‚Äôt like?"

tea,"Hello everyone, I‚Äôve recently got into tea and I‚Äôm unsure If i‚Äôm making my tea correctly. The reason I am suspicious is I like the taste of all my tea, including the black tea, and I was expecting it to be somewhat bitter and require time to get used to. For example I just made a cup of black chai, here‚Äôs how I made it.

Water temperature of 208 F.

1.75 teaspoons of loose leaf black tea

Steep for 4.15 minutes in 8 ounces of water

[Here](https://ibb.co/pPrL6q0) is an image of the tea.

I really expected the black tea to be overly powerful and require cream and sugar, but it‚Äôs actually quite good and not bitter‚Äî is this because it‚Äôs good tea and made correctly, or because it‚Äôs weaker than it should be. I know the most important part is if I like the taste, but i‚Äôm just nervous I could do more with my tea. Thank you! New to tea, I can‚Äôt tell if i‚Äôm making tea correctly."

When I add more water later in the day, the flavor is distinctly more fishy/seaweedy. It's not bad, but if you told me it was a totally different tea I would believe you. 

Is this expected ( I know with gong Fu, different infusions will give different notes), or something that can be fixed? Need advice: second water of grandpa style milk oolong."
tea,"I was making chamomile earlier today and remembered that awful post about the person who sucked the tea bags dry. I couldn't help it. I couldn't believe what I was doing, and before I knew it, I had drained the last of the essence out of the bags. What have I become



Edit: I wanted to give a more detailed account into what happened. I can't tell my wife.

It was a hot day compared to most around this time of year. I decided to work out anyway, as I wanted to push myself to the limit to be as fit as possible. I did my pushups and let the sweat fall onto my yoga mat. ""I'm getting there"" I said to myself, feeling my arms go weak. Fast forward to the post workout cool down. I'm listening to zero 7 and preparing to sit outside and gaze at the cherry tree. I noticed it's tinges of red from my window, and was curious to find these fruits. I was in luck, as the sun-bathed cherries had ripened faster than the others. I delighted in picking them, and handling their delicate summer forms as I was about to show them the greatest appreciation I could give them, to consume them. I thought that a nice cup of chamomile would be great to go with these cherries, and quickly donned a flowy white button up shirt, to hide my aching and swollen biceps+triceps, and made my cup of chamomile. I sat outside and enjoyed the supple and unusually ripe cherries, delighting in their distinct flavor. As I washed this down with even the lowest of grocery store chamomiles, I was in ecstasy. I was fully appreciating these items, and the deep, undulating pains of my sweat-laden body from such an intense workout. I re entered my house with my mug and spent tea bags, and placed it on the counter. My mind was buzzing, and the privacy of my home had enveloped my senses. I gazed at the tea bags and thought about that post I had seen earlier in the day. I couldn't help but laugh, and lift the bags to examine them. I could see that they were swollen, just as I was from working out in the summer heat. They wanted to drip, but held their moisture perfectly, like a cup that was full to the point of seeing the surface tension on the water. My curiosity had initiative over my reasoning, and as they dangled before me I had realized why someone would have such an affinity for sucking these things dry. They inched closer to my mouth to my own excitement and horror, my mouth opening and head contorting to properly dangle these bags by their flags, into my void and animal mouth. Like a baby suckling it's first teet, I found my entire mouth contorting around these bags like it was programmed in my DNA. I sucked and I sucked, marveled by the waves of flavor that unfolded onto my tongue. Wave after wave, suck after suck, like a gobstopper that pulsed it's life and death like heartbeats, the likes of which my sucks have given life to, countless tales of flavors of the modest and beautiful chamomile flower were presented to me. As if stricken by the fear and reason of god, I quickly removed the bags from my mouth and dropped them into my black mug, examining how shriveled they were, feeling the bitterness in my entire mouth. I felt so disgusting and ashamed, and shocked. My glow of perfection interrupted by this disgusting display of degeneracy. I tossed them into the trash and danced myself to sleep listening to Maroon 5, trying to forget. But I could never forget something as amazing as that. I sucked the tea bags."

Tell tale signs of slip casting (but absence doesn't mean it's not) are totally smooth inside and out. Seams which run the full length of the pot including the handle and spout. Exterior features translated to the inside and a handle which is hollow/visible from inside. 

Some signs your pot is handmade or ""half handmade"" are tooling marks on the inside and other remnants from the build process. Counter intuitively as well, the handmade pot is likely to be thinner. It's hard to articulate all the little things to look for, it's best to [know how they are made](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ju4Q-LdN9UI) to know what to look for, but you're looking at the general construction in ways that couldn't be slip cast. A mold seam doesn't mean it wasn't hand made, most pots the rough shape of the body is formed by hand then a mold is pressed around it and it s hand formed to the mold shape. 

Is your pot ""fully"" hand made? If you're asking, no it's probably not.

IMO you don't need to spend a lot to get a nice pot. There is a lot of negative opinion toward slip casting and I would generally agree with some of it and avoid them. But you don't need to spend big money either for just a simple every day pot without a name or extra frills, the difference between a $25 pot and a $60 one is likely going to come down to the middlemans take, not some unverifiable claim about clay quality. Some ways to tell slip cast vs ""half"" handmade."
tea,"I usually read that cold-brewed tea (be it in the fridge or room temperature) has less caffeine that traditionally steeped tea. I've also read that they have similar amounts of caffeine. So which is it?

Given the same amounts of tea and water, how does the caffeine extraction of a long-duration (many hours) steeping in cold water compare with a short (1-5 minutes) steeping in hot or boiling water? Might the answer also depend on the type of tea? Fannings in a bag vs whole leaf?

I recently thought about starting to sell my homemade tea. This would include international shipping... 
So i started to research a bit how teas are normally sold when loose or in teabags and ive seen 2 ways so far.. One seems to be this kind of brown lunchbag paper bag and the other a ziploc bag.. Which one do you guys think would work best for minimal flavour loss but save shipping? 
Im worried that the ziploc might condense due to temperature difference. And for the paper im not sure if it wouldnt loose too much flavour....
Have you any experiences regarding this topic or maybe any other ideas for wrapping the tea?

tea,"I didn't want a super long title, so to be clear: being unable to smell flowers also affects how you taste plant-based things. I'm pretty sure it's affecting how I taste tea compared to everyone else's reactions. Apparently my mom never knew this about me until we started discussing teas and she said the flavors in her sample packs were very strong, and she drinks it straight.

Is there anyone else here who also cannot smell flowers yet really enjoys teas? Maybe I'm doing something wrong?

I bought the Sweets and Jasmine boxes from Adagio. I've been using a House Again Extra Fine Mesh Tea Infuser. I'm mainly focusing on the Sweets because they're black teas and I've been needing caffeine lately.

* 1 cup of purified water / 1 teaspoon of loose leaf (in the strainer)
* Just barely get to boiling (210F as I'm at about 1,000ft altitude)
* Let it cool down slightly by swishing it around in the pot for about a minute, off the flame
* Pour the water in the cup and place the infuser (loose leaf already inside) inside the cup
* More time = more bitter, right? So I've tried 2, 2.5, and 3 minutes
* I usually put three small ice cubes in the tea because I'm impatient and have a tendency to accidentally burn my tongue. However, waiting naturally doesn't seem to change the result.
* Re-steeping removes the bitterness and a lot of the flavor (slightly more time, more immediately off the flame, must add honey)

I thought I was doomed forever until I had tea from a nearby Chinese tea shop. There was definitely some sugar and honey but it really smacked me in the face with flavor, and it was a jasmine tea!

&amp;#x200B;

So, what am I doing wrong?

tea,"So I‚Äôve been on a huge tea kick for the past year and I‚Äôm looking to get more seriously into sheng puer. I‚Äôve had a couple of offerings from Yunnan Sourcing and I drank my way through a full cake of 2003 Feng Qing Jia Ji Er Deng from them, which I loved. I was wondering if anyone had some advice regarding both how to get more seriously into puer tea and about certain vendors, particularly White2Tea and Crimson Lotus tea. Also, if anyone has any strong recommendations for a puer tea to try (or any particularly awesome tea for that matter) I would love to hear it! Where to buy really good puer?"

&amp;#x200B;

and I'm using green and oolong teas, and I want to steep them twice/three times. So what I do is go by the instructions, 1-2 tsp per cup for the green tea for example then steep for 1 minute. Then about an hour later, I just keep the same loose tea in there and put the same temp recommended water in again and steep for maybe a little longer than the first time.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this what people mean when they say steep more than once? Because I just read the proper way to do it is to use a very small teapot and steep for 1 minute for example, pour, then add more water right away, pour again, repeat over and over until you pour enough for a cup. I hope the way that I do it is correct because it would be  much easier lol Am I steeping (more than once) correctly?"

tea,"The Chinese were the first major producers and drinkers of this blessed beverage, since the plant obviously originates there in the border regions with India and Myanmar.

It has since been exported to all corners of the world, with many places even successfully growing tea within their own countries.

I'm still wondering though how why places chose to adopt green rather than black tea. As far as I know green tea loses its flavour a lot quicker when compared to black tea when stored or pressed into bricks. That's why harsh places like Russia or Mongolia neighbouring China were black tea drinkers mostly.

In China all tea varieties are produced and consumed, however South Asian tea producing countries almost all consume black tea exclusively and very miniscule amounts of other varities in comparison.

Across the sea of East China there's Japan which had tea introduced rather early. It's known as the home of all the now famous Japanese green teas and products derived from it. Very little black tea is consumed there.

Taiwan is the place of Oolong.

The UK is also associated with black tea rather than green, which follows the growing and drinking patterns of its former tea colonies.

Seeing how iced tea is pretty much the national drink of the US South and prepared using sweetened black tea, I think you can classify the US as more of a black tea place as well.

Much of the Middle East and Arab world are primarily black tea drinkers too. Turkish tea is even made from homegrown tea leaves in the Black Sea region.

North Africa however is a green tea stronghold. The national beverage of several countries there ""Mint tea"" is prepared using green gunpowder tea mixed with native mints and enjoyed all throughout the vast space there including the Sahara desert.

Is there any historical to this? Because you can make all varieties of tea anywhere. They can make black tea in Japan the same way they can make green one in India since it is the same plant.

I'm not including white, yellow or puerh cause those are rather rare outside of East Asia now. What are the reasons behind different regions of the world choosing green or black tea as their staple?"

You see a pot of gyokuro at work is a pain in the arse, but a little gaiwan? That seems like it should be pretty good right?

i was a huge coffee drinker for many years, but as i get older i can handle caffeine less and less well and i need to limit how much i consume to lower and lower amoun ts. i switched to black tea, which made a HUGE difference and i really really love breakfast teas, assam, stuff like that. 

i was hoping ppl had recommendations for black teas that are relatively low in caffeine that are still good. doesn't need to be ZERO caffeine, just lower than ordinary or the assam im drinking rn is fine. 

i don't know much about tea, but i know i like english breakfast and assam w/ cream. i tried the ""lapsang"" tea that's really smoky and i hated it fwiw.

 hope this helps u help me and hope this type of post is allowed. thanks a lot guys could you please recommend me a black tea without too much caffeine?"
tea,"I have a lovely white rose bush.  We do not use chemicals on it or any garden plants.  It has several blooms on it currently and I'd really like to make some rose water and rose tea with them.  I was hoping to get advice for the best way to get the most flavor.  Should I use only petals or petals and leaves?  Should I dry first in my oven at 140 (lowest setting) or hang dry? Or should I just use them fresh and gently washed? Any ideas on how long to steep?  Or at what temp?  I've made clover tea, dead nettle tee, and mint tea from my gardens before, but this will be my first from this rose bush. Making rose tea, how best would you go about it?"

For a little backstory, I first had this tea when I was in elementary/middle school. It was supposed to be a seasonal flavor and I kept missing it at the local tea shop, In college, I found out that they stopped making it over 10 years ago and that I can't special order it through them since their supplier does not have the ingredients for it anymore. But it is one of my favorite cups of tea and I want to be able to share it with my partner someday.

I know it's a white tea with cinnamon flavor. It has some candy hearts, and some little sticks.

What are your favorite tea flavors? Since Polls doesn't let you pick more than one (that I can find) just pick your favorite and leave a comment on how you like to combine them? 

Personally, I like Warm, woody flavors like Ginger and Cinnamon in a good African Red. 

Or some Clove mixed with Dragon Well and Maple Syrup. 

Herby/Grassy Teas are good, though I tend to lean more towards things like Peppermint, things with strong flavors, in that category. 

My LEAST favorite are the Floral teas. I just can't develop a liking to most of them.

tea,"I like to use ""Add ins"" for some of my teas. They can really bring out a new level of flavor and dimension. 

Recently I've been using Chinese Five Spice for some of my more Fruity, Spicy and Sweet teas. Things like Cherry Hibiscus, Beagle Spice (Celestial brand) or Ginger Dragon Well. 

But Chinese Five Spice doesn't lend itself well to Colder Teas, as it doesn't dissolve easily. 

So I've been looking in to alternatives. I've narrowed it down to the Clove and Star Anise components that work best. Clove is easily enough, but  star anise suffers the same problem as the cinnamon; its great for hot teas, but doesn't dissolve easily in cold ones. 

Someone recommended trying licorice powder instead. But its hard to find for some reason. 

Anyone know if it will work? and if so, where I can get it? Licorice Power to add to Fruity and Spicy Teas?"

Context: Born, raised in Britain, so always had tea + milk in background (Tetley's, PG Tips, Yorkshire), then two decades in Taiwan with the iced tea street culture. But also got into the habit of drinking a couple of beers at the end of each day, more at the weekends

Got sick of drinking during lockdown, gaining weight, making bad food choices, occasional hangovers, the dull habit and the expenditure on something that wasn't good for me

Stopped drinking just before my last birthday, and decided to channel my natural OCD/habit-forming nature into tea, buying a selection of loose leaf green, black and white teas, fruit/herbal tisanes and a nice cast iron teapot. Ritual and aesthetics are important to me, as is the ability to get wired or chill-out

Two months in and the habit has stuck. I drink tea all day - moving between the various teas, then onto herbals in the late afternoon, sleepy times in the evening (plus water, to cleanse the palate, stay hydrated)

I don't mind the loose leaves just chilling at the bottom of the container and if i ever get a leaf in my cup i just scoop it out with a fork.  


I tried this Gunpowder green tea but it has a slight fishy taste compared to the Purelife so i'm not a fan.

What I dont understand - Is the whole setup more related to the way how tea is consumed (you actually keep the pots hot for a couple of hours and you just take a cup when you like) or is there also a difference in the flavour compared to the usual western style? Why cant I just make strong tea without having to use two pots and litres of water?

Happy for explanations,

Cheers Purpose of a caydanlik"

* Ships fast

1. What kind of pitcher do I use that lets me put hot water in it to steep the tea and then put it right into the fridge before it's cooled?  I don't want to use plastic and I'm worried glass will break from the temperature extremes.
2. How do I steep tea in a large quantity?  I love my single cup tea basket infuser, but it won't accommodate enough leaves for 36 or 48 ounces of tea. What are my options?

tea,"Greetings, fellow tea drinkers.

Due to several annoying circumstances, I've been unable to drink much tea for the past couple years. But even worse than that, even before I had stopped drinking tea, my favourite tea maker outsourced the makings of their tea to another maker and the quality dropped significantly. So now I'm stuck with a lovely new temp controlled kettle and no proper tea to drink.

My favourites are Jasmine Pearls, Gunma Cha/Genmai Cha, Russian Caravan, Oolongs, Lapsang Souchong, and Earl Grey, but I'm always open to trying most things. I also enjoy herbals, but am typically not a fan of rooibos. Greens, Blacks, Whites, and Oolong are all wonderful. Please help me!

tea,My question is exactly as above. She only used it once but I know how aggressive coffee can be in smell and taste when it gets stuck in the plastic lids of thermoses.

Will I be able to get away with long baking soda bath or baking soda and vinegar? She's acting like I'm being overdramatic or something.

I don't have a kyusu, only a traditional Western-style 24oz teapot, some 12oz infuser cups, and a 100ml gaiwan for brewing vessels. From what I gather, brewing sencha in a gaiwan is unpleasant because the leaf absorbs the water and clogs the lid, and I worry that it may be difficult to brew sencha in such a large teapot.

I would love to experiment, but my sample for each green tea only contains 10g of tea, and I don't want to waste it all before getting to drink it! Would any of the brewing vessels/styles I have available to me suit these teas at all, or should I wait for my next paycheck to invest in a kyusu pot? Sencha Without Kyusu?"

tea,"Some backstory/findings (Question below)
Hello people of this beautiful subreddit! I recently ordered and received a pack of butterfly pea flowers, dry. I heated some water (I dont have the same meticulous procedures as some of you may have), put some leaves in an infuser (not sure how it's called) and I put in the hot (almost boiling) water. At first it was a very light blue, but it very quickly became vivid forest green. Adding lemon made it brown/golden. Cold brewing made it insanely purple, almost gray/black in color, but after a few days it also turned golden. Funny thing is, the first batch I mentioned, I left in the sink for later cleanup, and it leaked the deepest blue I've seen in any picture online (too bad it was in dirty dish-water), made a whole cup this beautiful blue, to which I added some lemon juice it turned a mesmerizing pinkish purple. 

My question is how do I consistently get that vivid and lively blue color without having to worry about the rest of the spectrum. I dont need to make a big batch that I can count on for later use, I prefer to make it on the spot, be it cold brew or hot. I just need to hit that consistency. Suffice to say I've gone through only the first like 6 results on google, I expect this sub to have a better answer Confusing butterfly pea tea colors"

tea,"I am trying to drink more green tea. I have a small travel water boiler which makes enough for a single cup. However, I don‚Äôt have a travel cup, nor loose leaf tea to use with said cup. 

I‚Äôve thought about buying a thermos that has room for loose leaf tea at the bottom. But I also know that tea ‚Äúpackets‚Äù exist where you just drop them into the water and then pull them out once brewing is done.

My ultimate goal is to be able to carry tea with me in my backpack such that I can make a cup at any time and drink it during traveling, but not add too much weight to my backpack. Bonus points if whatever I buy doubles as good for camping, since I already have a camping pot I can boil water with. 

Thanks for any suggestions! Looking for travel tea options, mostly green."
tea, Anyone seen or heard about this type of tea before?
tea,"Any time someone disagrees with a tasting note I write for tea, they are not 'wrong‚Äô, because I am not ‚Äòright‚Äô ‚Äì Everyone perceives things differently, and that is not solely based on ability. There are several factors at play that I would like to review and perhaps have a conversation about if you feel so inclined.

**Sample Material Variability:**  
Despite coming from the same source, one 5g sample of tea will not be the same as the next 5g, though in most cases they should be very similar. As surely every tea drinker has witnessed, tea from the ‚Äòtop of the bag/tin‚Äô is different in size from that which finds its way to the bottom. Different sizes will extract at different rates.

Secondly, if 1g of the first samples 5g was trichome covered buds, but 2g of the second sample was trichome covered buds, a conscious consumer would *expect* the sensory experience between the two pots to be different; and this doesn‚Äôt even account for differences in water, teaware, etc.

**Infusion and Perception Variability:**  
Our ability to discover an aroma in something (depending on what it is) can be as impressive as 1 part per trillion for the most odorous compounds known. That‚Äôs equivalent to a 1mL drop in a lake-sized body of water! This ability stretches and shrinks between different chemical compounds over at least 11 orders of magnitude.

Different volatile chemical compounds in the tea leaf will be released into the water at different lengths of infusion time. Different volatile chemicals in an infused tea will be released into the air at different times. The most volatile compounds are released first and don‚Äôt linger. As they fade, the medium volatile compounds begin to appear. As the medium volatile compounds fade, the least volatile compounds come into focus and persist. The perfume industry refers to these stages as the top, heart, and base notes of an aroma.

Therefore despite their best efforts, someone who doesn‚Äôt interact with the tea during the first several minutes after it has been brewed will miss several stages of the aroma development; and someone who doesn‚Äôt try to appreciate the aroma of the tea may only find its top notes, it stands to reason why opinions can differ so greatly.

The sensitivity of our palates and our ability to transcribe scents to words is another factor. I am surely partially blind or totally blind to certain compounds and hypersensitive to others, and the reverse will be true for the next person. In extreme cases, 2 people could smell the same odor and describe it completely differently. This is perhaps not due to our physical limitations to detect aroma but our lack of fluency in describing what we smell, perhaps both. In the food and fragrance industries, companies will form panels of judges so that their averages can paint a more reliable picture of what people perceive.

I brew and recommend my customers to brew teas with rather specific extraction parameters. The reason is that through my testing, to my taste, and what I can perceive with my abilities and circumstances, I‚Äôve found those parameters will create an infusion that puts the tea in the best possible light. Although things taste differently from person to person, I do not have a panel of people to gather data from, nor do I believe that data would be useful at the scale of which I operate. I believe my parameters to be a wonderful starting point from which the recipient can adjust to suit their tasting ability.

**Elemental and Configurable Senses:**  
An aroma is not just a sum of its chemical parts, and our ability to comprehend an aroma comes down to how we perceive it. If two aromatic compounds are blended, one person may perceive the blend as identifiable compounds A + B while the next person may perceive it as C. The analyzable A + B compound is referred to as an elemental odor, while the C compound is a configural odor. If you put a Caprese salad in front of someone blindfolded and asked them what it is, do you think it‚Äôs more likely they say ‚Äòbasil, tomato, mozzarella, balsamic‚Äô or ‚ÄòCaprese salad‚Äô? What about tea? I don‚Äôt know about you but I‚Äôve met my fair share of people who don‚Äôt smell anything in tea but ‚Äòtea‚Äô.

I suppose it‚Äôs safe to say our comprehension of aroma is based on life experience. Configural sensing seems to be our default, we live on auto-pilot, and configural sensing saves us a lot of somewhat pointless thinking. Elemental sensing is something that can be learned and is especially useful in the process of ‚Äòreverse engineering‚Äô aromas. Depending on whether you find enjoyment in using your brain as an analytical tool, flipping the 'Elemental Sensing' switch to 'Always On' can be a very rewarding life choice. It just takes practice, awareness, and energy.

This is an article I will hopefully continue to expand on as I learn more about odor and how our bodies interact with it. If you think it's interesting, please consider sharing it with others. Bye for now! Tasting Notes?"

And what are your thoughts on Tsujiri?"
tea,"Im fairly new to the tea world but have quickly fallen in love. 

Lately, Ive been enjoying Harney‚Äôs japanese sencha hot, brewing 3g for about 100 seconds at 80C. However, after icing the same brew the tea I can no longer enjoy it. Instead of those steamed and lemony notes, I pick up a sort of sharp stale taste. 

Thinking my ice was not pure, I also tried just cold-brewing my tea for 18h with similar undesirable results. My tea looks great and smells great before brewing. Im sort of confused on why this is happening to me, especially considering that I will enjoy a cup even at room temperature.

tea,"Greetings,

Here's the deal. Yesterday I was using a Capresso glass kettle to boil my water for tea and it came out the same as all the previous days. Today, I bought a 3L Tiger kettle/warmer. I set it to 208F and made my tea exactly as I normally would.

Unfortunately, the tea came out very weak and almost flavorless.

Again. The ONLY thing that changed between yesterday and today is the kettle I used to boil the water.

Same water (tap) at the same temperature, same tea in the same amounts, same mugs, same steeping time. 

It wasn't just my tea, either. My wife complained that her tea today was weak and flavorless as well.

Any thoughts as to why this happened, and how I can fix it, beyond the obvious ""add more tea leaves""? Tea steep has changed?"
tea,"Sorry if this isn't the place to ask, but I've tried searching the internet and I can't really find anything conclusive.

In short:

What type of tea is grocery store ""Black Tea""?

Where can I find loose leaf versions of this ""Black Tea""? Store suggestions?

I grew up in the South on Luzianne tea, and now that I'm an adult, I've moved on to store-brand tea because there's no citrus in the tea and it's just plain black tea. Now, though, I'm trying to move away from using tea bags because using 5-6 individually wrapped tea bags per pitcher feels wasteful. So I wanted to look for just loose black tea, but apparently there's no such thing! I can't find anything just labeled black tea, any info on what kind of tea ""Black Tea"" is, and going to grocery stores (Kroger and Target), they don't even have tea that isn't in a bag.

Sorry if this isn't the right place to ask. If there's a better place, please feel free to point me in that direction! Couple questions about loose leaf black tea from someone who knows nothing!"

I am a poor college student and try to substitute my coffee with tea, mainly for financial reasons (coffee is very expensive where I live).

So I started to buy this very cheap off-brand ""classic"" black tea. The caffeine content is nowhere written on the box. The ingredients just say ""black tea"", nothing more. Google says black tea usually contains 30mg/100ml caffeine, so I drank about 4 (200ml/one teabag) cups, but they didn't do anything to me.

tea,"I recently decided to use Fibonacci numbers for creating a non-linear steeping sequence compared to the normal +5 or +10 seconds with each steep. So far I've been pleased with the test results, especially from a texture standpoint. Every steep seems to be very smooth, even the longer steep times with some astringent green teas have turned out well. I simply start with the closest fibonacci number to what the normal first steep would be and then increment according to the sequence. I've tried it out on green, fresh white, aged white, ripe puerh, raw puerh, and oolongs so far.

I'd be curious to hear from others if they've tried this before or would be willing to try it and post here  how they think it compares to the traditional time incrementation. Fibonacci sequence for tea steeping times (gong fu brewing)"

tea,"I tried another tea from Yunnan Sourcing today. I brewed it gongfu style. The aroma of the dry leaf is kind of dusty and I didn't find it very fragrant. The wet leaf is very floral and reminds me of a rosewater.

I had unique tastes from three infusions, and then it just became a weaker version of the third one. I went to five infusions, but I don't mind drinking relatively weak tea. 

1st: Sel gris, oat scones, clover honey, brown rock sugar,  longan, hibiscus

2nd: Clover honey, generic black tea, dried lime, verjuice, longan, hibiscus, brown rock sugar, earth, minerals

3rd: dried lime, generic black / dark oolong tea flavor, minerals, brown rock sugar

This was pleasant. None of the flavors here are big and bold. The tea is very pleasant and lacks noticeable astringency. I think this would make a nice western-style cup.

I love floral and fruity teas and so I wanted to try phoenix dancongs. Tea plants will naturally vary in taste, and people in the past discovered that particular tea plants had tastes that reminded them of things like jasmine or orchids. Cuttings are taken from these for new tea plants, so that these new tea plants will be genetically identical to the one that was found to have this particular fragrance.

This sounded great so I had previously tried a few phoenix dancong from Song Tea, specifically their Old Grove Honey Orchid and the Old Grove Jasmine Fragrance, and I followed their brewing instructions, but I wasn't able to pick up on the signature fragrances and tastes the teas are supposed to have.

According to people on Tea Forum, the shop Tea Habitat is supposed to be basically the best purveyor of phoenix dancongs in the US, so I gave them a try even though they are pricy. I tried the Xiang Dong Zhi Lan Xiang, which was amazing! Tea Habitat translates ""zhi lan xiang"" to ""cattleya orchid fragrance"" although I have seen Song Tea translate it as ""iris fragrance."" Xiang Dong is the name of a specific tree that is from the zhi lan xiang type, and in phoenix dancong cultivation, apparently some trees become particularly well known for producing particularly tasty tea (my guess is that there's probably environmental, epigenetic, and age factoring into this since all trees of a specific type should be genetically identical).

I was skeptical, but I brewed it according to her directions on the website (wasn't hard!) and it was amazing!! A lot of times when I drink tea, I have to be trying to get the things they say the tea tastes like. This one you don't have to do that. It's redolent with this floral fragrance and flavor, but not in a bad, overwhelming, or perfume-y way, just really, really pleasant. I get up and look forward to drinking it because it's so good. The taste reminds me of Maine Root's blueberry soda in a way.

Just as a note, if you're just brewing it in a cup, you can put 2 g of tea and 200 g of water and leave it in there, but Tea Habitat advises that you use a thin porcelain cup, which I think is important. I tried it both in a big ceramic bowl with a wide top that let the heat escape quickly (I didn't have a thin porcelain cup) and a thick ceramic mug, and the mug held in so much of the heat, that the lighter fragrances began to get covered up by the stronger flavors that are extracted from all the heat the mug was holding in. The bowl didn't have that issue as much, I think it's because it let more heat escape.

The gongfu brewing method (just started out with a 15 second brew for 2 g tea and 120 g of 210 F water in a thin porcelain gaiwan and added 10 seconds steep) was the best for tasting as much of the floral components as possible. As you steeped it more, you get a bit of this roasted, maybe charcoal flavor, just a hint, but it somehow seems to accentuate the floral flavor, it doesn't clash with it or cover it up, which helped me understand how roasting can actually accentuate a tea.

This tea is just incredible and really showed me how amazing phoenix dancongs can be. It's probably the flat out best tea I've ever had. I'm looking forward to trying more of Tea Habitat's teas, and will also be looking to get some from Wuyi Origin, which is supposed to be very good also.

They cut pampas grass and use it to cover the soil in the tea fields, which does a few things:

1. It helps store CO2 in the soil
2. It keeps the soil well drained, but moist at the same time, which gives the tea grown there morenutrients and good bacteria
3. Creates favorable environments for plants and animals

I will post links to a couple articles where you can read more about it if you're interested.

About 2-3 months ago, I bought this bag of sencha. It is not particularly high grade, I bought it in a store specialised in Japanese goods. Taste wise, it certainly has more layers than most tea bag green tea. But there is very little in the way of umami that I so crave. Not that I expect much at this price range. (\~6 USD for the whole bag, but in a developing country)

I am wary of the effects oxidation and moisture can have on green tea leaves, especially since I live in a tropical climate. My solution is to close the bag with a sealing clip, and putting the bag inside an airtight plastic container, with a few packets of (old) oxygen and moisture absorber for good measure.

I brewed this tea today after a while of not drinking it. The first difference I noticed was the fragrance of the dry tea leaves. It has became more muted, and has less of a toasted seaweed note. Once steeped, the liquor is much more yellowish/brownish than I remember. It used to be brighter, like lime, or chartreuse. But this time, it is darker, like mustard.

I took a sip, I am immediately hit with the taste of heated starch. Reminiscent of taro, or even baked Japanese sweet potato. Where crispness and freshness used to appear in its flavour profile, this starchiness has risen to take its place. It is certainly different, and not how sencha should be. But I must say this is, surprisingly not an objective downgrade. In fact, I have tasted a Taiwanese Oolong, Cui Feng Shui Xian, that has the exact same flavour note.

So I wonder if any of you have tasted the same note in green tea you have stored for a while. Do they always develop this flavour when oxidised? Or is there a particularity in the environment I have created that gave birth to this ~~abomination~~ unique specimen? Potato Sencha: A Story of Serendipitous Oxidation"

tea,"I ordered a gaiwan set online. Two serving cups, a gaiwan, and a tea boat.
I was excited, and I couldn't wait to try it out. I decided to make my nightly chamomile. I know using herbal teas in a gaiwan isn't traditional, but it sounded fun.

Well, I poured the warming water in. Since herbal tea is brewed at 212, I used that. It cracked. Right down the middle. [Pic](https://i.imgur.com/Lycpglt.jpg)

tea,"I remember drinking a tea just called ‚ÄúGood Earth Original‚Äù about 10 years ago. It was a little sweet and spicy I guess. 

Anyway I can‚Äôt find it now, apparently the company rebranded a few years ago and now they don‚Äôt make it? Sounds like their ‚Äúsweet and spicy‚Äù tea may be similar but I heard they changed the recipe. 

Anyone have any info on this? Thanks What Happened To Good Earth Original?"
tea,"I was recently gifted a travel mug with an infuser from David's tea. I typically don't use these but sometimes I'm in a rush and will use them on the go. 

Unfortunately, my roommate borrowed it and left some tea in it overnight. It now smells FOUL. We've taken the whole thing apart, including the rubber bits and scrubbed it head to toe multiple times. The smell is still there and I really don't want to drink out of it in its current state.

Anyone had this happen to them before? Any tips or tricks on cleaning/getting the smell out? Worried at this point I might have to toss it :(

tea,"I just had a most amazing and odd and delicious and unexpected oolong today.

I order occasionally from NieQun Tea on eBay, and he always throws interesting tea samples into my packages. Today, I grabbed a little box containing some oolong samples from Yunnan, from what looked like the Tengchong Jibian Tea Company. (They were marked, ""Commemorate the Chinese Expeditionary Force of CBI"" which, after some googling, turned up a bit of WWII history I had never heard about.)

Anyway, oolong tea from Yunnan? Huh, okay. I had no idea what this would be like, but I  got out the gaiwan, sniffed the leaves, noted some roasted notes, and brewed the sample at about 95 C. The aroma nearly blew me away. So fruity and sweet. (If I hadn't sampled a Taiwanese oolong last month with similar notes, I would have suspected this was flavored tea.) I got five strong infusions from the leaves, and then a couple weaker ones that were still pleasant.  It was a delight.

I looked up ""Tenchong Jibian"" for more information, and found out that it's both a company name and a place name. This area in Yunnan (called Jibian, in the county of Tengchong) is considered an alpine oolong tea region, similar to the Taiwanese tea growing regions. Another article said that the tea cultivar used in this area is QingXin (GreenHeart) -- the same cultivar that is used in the Taiwanese oolongs I love so much.

I'm now on the hunt for more tea like this. The samples I got were from a special edition released last year... I don't know what the equivalent product would be now. I see this company's products are available all over the internet, but I would love to have THIS tea again. The fruity one. The Taiwanese tea I sampled last month was from Taiwan Sourcing, and is no longer available...

tea,"pureleaf and gold peak range from ""meh"" to how did the tea in this bottle get this bitter and have this much of an after taste?

&amp;#x200B;

Now I know some people will respond, wtf are you doing drinking bottled tea in the first place.  Convenience, sometimes I just want to grab a bottle and go without pre brewing.

&amp;#x200B;

So I come to you all now, in all your tea travels, have you EVER come across a brand of iced tea that was bottled/canned that was unsweetened that tasted decent (and by decent I mean after using a non sugar based sweetener) Is there any bottled unsweetened iced tea that does not taste like garbage?"

tea,"I had a gorgeous tea a while back, given to me by workers in a kebab shop after a night out. It was therefore probably of Turkish or Middle Eastern origin.

It was a black tea, but of quite a lightish colour (relative to black tea in general), served with no milk or sugar, but was slightly sweet. Not bitter at all. Very refreshing.

No sediment in the bottom. I don‚Äôt think it was a type of chai; all the chai I‚Äôve had has been much sweeter and not particularly pleasant for my tastes, though I‚Äôve only tasted ‚ÄòEnglish‚Äô Chai, from Twinnings, Whittard and the like, which is I suspect is to chai what a tikka masala is the real Indian food.

This was more like a conventional black tea that was softer and lighter in flavour (as well as aforementioned in look), slightly sweet, had no bitterness to speak of.

It was served in a small, clear glass cup of a strange shape: it had a sort of ‚Äòneck‚Äô and then sprouted at the top, and more bulbous shape for the body and a small handle of some description.

I‚Äôd love to know it. I used to drink tea without milk but these days only drink Assam, or occasionally EB or Kenyan, which doesn‚Äôt work for me without milk, these days. What was this tea?"
tea,"This review is for [this Asahina gyokuro. ](https://www.yuuki-cha.com/organic-green-tea/gyokuro/asahina-gyokuro) I bought this tea because it's supposed to have strong oceanic notes. I tried the saemidori gyokuro which reminded me of a salty ocean breeze so I wanted to see what this tea had in store for me. 

Parameters: 4.5 grams of leaves, 8oz, 6oz, and 5oz of water respectively for each steep, 170¬∞, 2 minutes 20 seconds steep time. 

I didn't bother doing a wash because I wanted to experience the full tea drunk effects of the l theanine. The dry leaves smell very rich and super savory. After the 1st steep, the wet leaves smell super savory sweet and densely rich. The smell is similar to the Kisekirei gyokuro. 

1st cup: Super savory, almost reminds me of some sort of savory chop sui on a wok with nice Carmelized onions and other spices. Rich but not thick, with a lingering savory aftertaste. The flavor reminds me of the Kisekirei gyokuro but slightly less rich. I don't taste or smell anything oceanic at this point. 

2nd cup: After the 2nd steep, the wet leaves have a slightly subtle but at the same time very prominent tide pool smell. I lived in coastal southern California most of my life and this is definitely taking me back to the tide pools that I went to as a child and teen along the coast in san diego county. Think about a strong saline ocean scent, mixed with wet sand, wet washed up seaweed, mixed with the smell of... this might sound strange, but.... marine biology? Like sea anemone and sea stars, corals and other life. Wet, sandy, saline, with fresh wet washed up seaweed. As for the taste, it has a mildly roasted flavor with subtle astringency. Honestly the taste is completely different from the 1st cup. 

3rd cup: After the 3rd steep, now the wet leaves have a very prominent wet seaweed and wet sand smell with strong saline beach scents. This is definitely taking me back to my younger years, imagining dragging a huge pile of fresh washed up seaweed across the wet sand along the tide pools. The taste is super sweet with a pleasantly thin viscosity/body in the mouth. The tea itself has strong scents of wet sand and fresh wet piles of washed up seaweed. 

Overall: WOW! This is definitely more oceanic than the Saemidori! The Saemidori reminds me of an ocean breeze whereas the Asahina literally puts me right on the sand with all the marine biology, wet sand and saline breeze smells. I'm very pleased with this Asahina gyokuro! It's like a trip down memory lane to the tide pools. Asahina gyokuro-At the tide pools."
